gdirA focuses on a simple, subcommand-first CLI that mirrors common shell tools. All state (keywords and history pointer) lives in one JSON document under ~/.config/gdirA/, so saving and inspection stay straightforward. History behaves like a browser stack: navigating after a back truncates the forward branch, and commands return selection errors (exit 2) when a move is impossible. Outputs intentionally stay minimalâ€”`go`, `back`, and `fwd` emit only the resolved absolute path to keep wrapper scripts trivial. Listing keeps insertion order with stable indices and fixed-width numbering for readability. The trade-off of a monolithic JSON file is that concurrent edits are unsafe, but the clarity and atomic saves suit the single-user workflow envisioned here.
