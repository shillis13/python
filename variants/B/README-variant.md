gdirB embraces a flag-centric interface so the main actions stay script-friendly. Every persisted record lives as a JSONL row, while the history pointer sits in its own fileâ€”small rewrites keep append workflows straightforward and avoid rewriting large blobs. History acts like a stack trimmed on divergence; the pointer survives new processes via the dedicated state file. The richer `-E` export prints PREV/NEXT plus per-key variables for shells that want quick shortcuts. Trade-offs: JSONL needs full rewrites for edits, and short flags can be harder to memorize, but the format makes diffing and manual edits simpler for power users.
