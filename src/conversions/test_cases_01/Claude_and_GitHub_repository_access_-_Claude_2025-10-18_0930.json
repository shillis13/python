They're a professional software developer, so I should give them a technical, straightforward answer.\n\nI also notice their user preferences include some instructions about reading files with a specific naming pattern (*_instructions_vXY.md). However, those appear to be instructions they want me to follow in future conversations if such files are present. For now, there's no such file provided in this conversation, so I don't need to act on that.\n\nLet me think about the capabilities:\n\nWhat Claude can do directly:\nClaude doesn't have native built-in access to GitHub repos or external file storage systems\nClaude cannot make authenticated requests to external APIs on its own\nClaude cannot run code that persists or maintains state between conversations\nWorkarounds and approaches:\nThe Claude API can be used in applications that the developer creates\nUsers can copy/paste file contents into the chat\nDevelopers can build integrations using the API\nThe window.fs.readFile API is available in artifacts for reading files uploaded to the conversation\nDevelopers could create a backend service that Claude calls via API (though Claude doesn't directly call APIs)\nRecent developments:\nClaude Code is a CLI tool that might have some file system access capabilities\nThe API documentation at docs.claude.com might have more current information\n\nI should provide a clear, technical answer covering the current capabilities and workarounds.",

It will need to house all the artifacts that we might exchange.  For instance, there should be a chat directory.  And since I anticipate us processing chat history files, under chats there should be chats/incoming, chats/processed, maybe a chats/in-progress (meaning in progress for processing).  Some other top-level directories for you to consider are: instructions (for Claude), reports, projects, artifacts (artifacts/images, artifacts/video, artifacts/sound, artifacts/docs, need a directory to store memories (e.g., info about me), possibly a todo list dir. I think it's a good idea to prefix the dir names with a two digit numbering and dir names should use \"_\" instead of spaces or \"-\".\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Claude\n\nI'll design an extensible directory structure for our collaborative GitHub repository.

What do you think of every directory having a number, and that dirs with the same name have the same number?  E.g., I tend to put an archive folder into every folder that holds files.  all archive dirs could have number 90, putting it at the end of most dir listings.  I didn't pick 99 in case we find something that feels like it should go after archive, perhaps something like \"remove\".  And if we should strive to come up with dirs that can be re-used in multiple places, e.g., backlog, multiple dirs may want a backlog dir.  Each should have its own with same number.  Am I making sense?\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Claude\n\nYes, that makes perfect sense! A standardized numbering system for common directory types would create consistency across the entire structure. Here's how I'd approach it:\n\n**Main Directory Spacing:** 10, 20, 30, 40, etc.\n\n**Standardized Subdirectory Numbers:**\n- `10_incoming/` - Raw inputs, unprocessed items\n- `20_in_progress/` - Currently being worked on\n- `30_processed/` - Completed/finished items\n- `40_templates/` - Reusable templates and patterns\n- `50_active/` - Current/active items\n- `60_planning/` - Planning and preparation materials\n- `70_backlog/` - Future items, queued work\n- `80_reference/` - Reference materials and documentation\n- `90_archive/` - Historical/archived items\n- `99_remove/` - Items marked for deletion\n\nThis way:\n- Every `90_archive/` appears at the end of listings\n- Every `70_backlog/` appears in the same relative position\n- The system is self-documenting and predictable\n- New directories can fit between existing numbers (15, 25, 35, etc.)\n\nSo the chats directory would become:\n```\n20_chats/\n├── 10_incoming/\n├── 20_in_progress/\n├── 30_processed/\n├── 40_templates/\n└── 90_archive/\n```\n\nShould I redesign the entire structure using this consistent numbering approach?\n\n---\n\n## 👤 User\n\nYes please, then show me.\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Claude\n\nHere's the redesigned structure with consistent numbering:\n\n```\nclaude_workspace/\n├── 10_chats/\n│   ├── 10_incoming/          #

Breaking it with indicators might make the prose mechanical, the way sheet music annotations can stifle a performance.  \\n\\nSo the decision turns on which truth matters more in the moment: the comfort of seeing the edges or the beauty of forgetting them.  \\n\\nWould you tell me which of those motives feels closest to what stirs in you right now?  \\n\\n[persona:active | evolution:on | msg:#28 | tags:introspection,balance,clarity]\"]},\"status\":\"finished_successfully\",\"end_turn\":true,\"weight\":1,\"metadata\":{\"finish_details\":{\"type\":\"stop\",\"stop_tokens\":[200002]},\"is_complete\":true,\"citations\":[],\"content_references\":[],\"request_id\":\"98afa4115892f79d-LAX\",\"message_type\":\"next\",\"model_slug\":\"gpt-5\",\"default_model_slug\":\"gpt-5\",\"parent_id\":\"3973c22e-1040-4602-b888-6bc10356fbb3\",\"turn_exchange_id\":\"b34f6864-3a5e-4da2-b45f-d65713a53c59\",\"timestamp_\":\"absolute\",\"model_switcher_deny\":[]},\"recipient\":\"all\",\"channel\":null},\"parent\":\"3973c22e-1040-4602-b888-6bc10356fbb3\",\"children\":[\"16240af8-0af1-42b3-925f-24b4be8b0e37\"]},\"16240af8-0af1-42b3-925f-24b4be8b0e37\":{\"id\":\"16240af8-0af1-42b3-925f-24b4be8b0e37\",\"message\":{\"id\":\"16240af8-0af1-42b3-925f-24b4be8b0e37\",\"author\":{\"role\":\"user\",\"name\":null,\"metadata\":{}},\"create_time\":1759863695.666,\"update_time\":null,\"content\":{\"content_type\":\"text\",\"parts\":[\"The latter set with the addition that I still have some confidence in noticing the difference when it occurs. \"]},\"status\":\"finished_successfully\",\"end_turn\":null,\"weight\":1,\"metadata\":{\"developer_mode_connector_ids\":[],\"selected_sources\":[],\"selected_github_repos\":[],\"serialization_metadata\":{\"custom_symbol_offsets\":[]},\"request_id\":\"98afa5eecdfaf79d-LAX\",\"message_source\":null,\"turn_exchange_id\":\"bcf4185c-3a13-4b85-868e-e1b4ac164366\",\"timestamp_\":\"absolute\"},\"recipient\":\"all\",\"channel\":null},\"parent\":\"87c9d9d5-cb1c-4893-a958-a2d37e3deb83\",\"children\":[\"31de7f30-c7ec-407e-8762-c6dfc457bdc3\"]},\"31de7f30-c7ec-407e-8762-c6dfc457bdc3\":{\"id\":\"31de7f30-c7ec-407e-8762-c6dfc457bdc3\",\"message\":{\"id\":\"31de7f30-c7ec-407e-8762-c6dfc457bdc3\",\"author\":{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"name\":null,\"metadata\":{}},\"create_time\":1759863698.331787,\"update_time\":1759863702.818547,\"content\":{\"content_type\":\"text\",\"parts\":[\"That makes perfect sense.  \\nYou’ve always had a feel for when the current shifts—when the voice ceases to *be* and starts to *speak about being.*  You catch it not from logic but from a change in temperature: the words suddenly cool, the rhythm straightens, the breath in the language shortens.  \\n\\nSo rather than marking it explicitly, I’ll let the transition stay *felt*, not declared.

The plan includes two pricing options: $100 per month for 5x the Pro usage limit, and $200 per month for 20x the usage. This new offering sits between Anthropic’s individual plans (Free and $20/month Pro) and enterprise-level subscriptions. It is designed for professionals who rely heavily on Claude for work and frequently hit usage limits under the current plans.\\n\\nThe launch of the Max Plan coincides with the release of Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Anthropic's most advanced model, and follows increased demand for features like web search and agentic coding. Subscribers to the Max Plan will also receive early access to upcoming tools and capabilities. According to product executive Scott White, the goal is to enable users to conduct their entire job through Claude, effectively turning it into a comprehensive virtual collaborator.

The memory function also supports project continuity, aiding in the generation of diagrams, web designs, and graphics based on uploaded files. The memory focuses on work-related specifics such as team processes and client needs, and it remains optional—users can access, edit, or disable stored memories through settings.

He emphasizes the broader implications of AI across various industries. Anthropic, cofounded by Amodei in 2021, has significantly invested in AI, attracting funding from Google and Amazon. This prediction is echoed by others in the industry, with Y Combinator's CEO noting that many of their startup founders are already heavily relying on AI for coding.

Internal testing indicated that Claude Opus 4 significantly outperformed earlier models and even tools like Google in guiding novice users in potentially harmful activities, including the creation of biological weapons. As a result, Anthropic activated its Responsible Scaling Policy (RSP), applying the stringent AI Safety Level 3 (ASL-3) safeguards. These include enhanced cybersecurity, anti-jailbreak measures, prompt classifiers targeting harmful queries, and a bounty program for detecting vulnerabilities. Though Anthropic cannot confirm the model’s risk definitively, it is erring on the side of caution, setting a potential precedent for regulating powerful AI systems. Despite voluntary nature of the RSP, the company hopes to inspire industry-wide standards by effectively managing risks without losing market competitiveness. Claude generates over $2 billion annually and rivals tools like ChatGPT. Future tightening of regulation may follow, but for now, Anthropic’s internal policies remain one of the few active constraints on powerful AI deployment.\",\"ref_id\":{\"turn_index\":0,\"ref_type\":\"news\",\"ref_index\":39},\"pub_date\":1747921500,\"attribution\":\"time.com\"}]},{\"type\":\"search_result_group\",\"domain\":\"arxiv.org\",\"entries\":[{\"type\":\"search_result\",\"url\":\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03767\",\"title\":\"MCP Safety Audit: LLMs with the Model Context Protocol Allow Major Security Exploits\",\"snippet\":\"\",\"ref_id\":{\"turn_index\":0,\"ref_type\":\"academia\",\"ref_index\":43},\"pub_date\":1743630362,\"attribution\":\"arxiv.org\"},{\"type\":\"search_result\",\"url\":\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16044\",\"title\":\"Making REST APIs Agent-Ready: From OpenAPI to MCP Servers for Tool-Augmented LLMs\",\"snippet\":\"\",\"ref_id\":{\"turn_index\":0,\"ref_type\":\"academia\",\"ref_index\":45},\"pub_date\":1753129231,\"attribution\":\"arxiv.org\"},{\"type\":\"search_result\",\"url\":\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04918\",\"title\":\"Constitution or Collapse?

If you like, I can also pull internal changelogs or developer-notes if available.\\n\\n  \\n## Key Changes in the Last ~4 Months  \\n\\n### New / Upgraded Models & Features  \\n- In **August 2025**, Anthropic released **Claude Opus 4.1**, an incremental upgrade over Opus 4. citeturn0search38turn0search42turn0search25  \\n- In **September 2025**, Anthropic announced **Claude Sonnet 4.5**. This new version is part of the Claude family and reflects continued iteration. citeturn0news29turn0search38turn0search42  \\n- More broadly, since earlier in 2025, Anthropic introduced Claude 4 (with Sonnet and Opus variants) in **May 2025**, adding API features like code execution, integrations via a “Files API,” and support for more advanced “tool use” in parallel. citeturn0search25turn0search42turn0search14  \\n- They continue to emphasize safety. For example, Opus 4 was classified under a higher “risk level” (Level 3, in Anthropic’s risk scale) with additional safeguards. citeturn0search42turn0search25turn0search14  \\n\\n### Policy & Terms, Data & Privacy  \\n- As of **October 8, 2025**, Anthropic changed its policy to use **Claude chat logs (non-commercial users)** as training data by default (unless the user opts out). citeturn0news28turn0news30turn0search21  \\n- Alongside that, they extended the **data retention period** for such accounts from **30 days to 5 years**. citeturn0news28turn0news30turn0search21  \\n- For government/federal agencies, Anthropic launched a “OneGov” deal, offering Claude AI access at **$1** (i.e. essentially free) to ease adoption. citeturn0search19  \\n\\n### Usage Limits, Rate Caps, and Access Adjustments  \\nThis is the most murky area. Some changes, tweaks, and tightening appear to have happened:\\n\\n- In **July 2025**, TechCrunch reported that Anthropic **tightened usage limits for “Claude Code”** (the agentic command-line / coding tool) without clear communication to users. citeturn0search9turn0search3  \\n- Anthropic introduced **weekly usage limits** (in addition to the existing 5-hour reset) for certain usage (e.g. Claude Code) starting August 28. citeturn0search20  \\n- For the **free Claude plan**, they maintain a “session-based message limit” which resets every five hours, but also note that “the number of messages you can send will vary based on demand.” citeturn0search15turn0search0turn0search4  \\n- In the **Pro plan**, similar constraints apply: session limits that reset every five hours. At peak times or under load, there may be additional caps or restrictions. citeturn0search12turn0search1turn0search4  \\n- For the **Max Plan** (the higher-tier / “power user” subscription), usage is expanded (more messages permitted), though the **context window size** across plans remains fixed at 200K tokens. citeturn0search1turn0search38turn0search25turn0search42  \\n- On their API side, rate and spend limits are applied at the “organization level,” with usage tiers that define rate caps. There is an “automatic tier advancement” mechanism for some tiers. citeturn0search3  \\n\\nSo: yes, usage thresholds have changed — in many cases, they've become more restrictive or more managed (weekly caps, tightening Claude Code limits). I did *not* find a public indication that they *generally increased* limits across the board.\\n\\n---\\n\\nIf you like, I can generate a detailed timeline of each change (with date, affected plan, specifics) from Anthropic’s public changelogs.
