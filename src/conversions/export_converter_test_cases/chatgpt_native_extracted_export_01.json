You’d get a pretty good idea by watching a clip highlighting the “Watchman Decree” from a recent FlashPoint Live event in Georgia. \\nL171: \\nL172: On July 1, a slew of conservative Christians, including conspiracy theorist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and anti-abortion zealot Abby Johnson, gathered to do far more than pray. During the event, host Gene Bailey urged the Christian audience and everyone watching the livestream to join together and recite what he called the “【37†Watchman Decree†flashpoint.govictory.com】.” \\nL173: \\nL174: Watchmen, in this case, refer to people who pledge to watch over the nation and make sure it’s run according to conservative Christian principles. Writer and activist Nick Knudsen shared the clip that went viral, but you can 【38†see it for yourself at the 1:24:00 mark†flashpoint.govictory.com】 in this video.\\nL175: \\nL176: > Here's a higher quality version of what 【39†@NickKnudsenUS†twitter.com】 shared earlier. 【40†https://t.co/JnLSnJjvzx†t.co】 【41†pic.twitter.com/phGtGrKe7I†t.co】\\nL177: > \\nL178: > — Hemant Mehta (@hemantmehta) 【42†July 15, 2022†twitter.com】\\nL179: \\nL180: After explaining how conservative Christians are “God’s governing Body on the earth” and have “legal power from heaven” to “destroy every attempted advance of the enemy,” they declare the following:\\nL181: \\nL182: > We decree that America’s executive branch of government will honor God and defend the Constitution.\\nL183: > \\nL184: > We decree that our legislative branch (Congress) will write only laws that are righteous and constitutional.\\nL185: > \\nL186: > We decree that our judicial system will issue rulings that are biblical and constitutional.\\nL187: > \\nL188: > We declare that we stand against wokeness, the occult and every evil attempt against our nation.\\nL189: > \\nL190: > We declare and we now take back our God-given freedoms, according to our Constitution.\\nL191: > \\nL192: > We declare that we take back influence at the local level in our communities.\\nL193: > \\nL194: > We decree that we take back and permanently control positions of influence and leadership in each of the *Seven Mountains.\\nL195: > \\nL196: > We decree that the blood of Jesus covers and protects our nation. It protects and separates us for God.\\nL197: > \\nL198: > We declare that our nation is energy independent.\\nL199: > \\nL200: > We declare that America is strong spiritually, financially, militarily and technologically.\\nL201: > \\nL202: > We decree that evil carries no power, authority or rights in our land nor over our people.\\nL203: > \\nL204: > We decree that we will operate in unity, going beyond denominational lines in order to accomplish the purposes of God for our nation.\\nL205: \\nL206: While some of that is just a rehash of conservative talking points (e.g. “wokeness,” “God-given freedoms,” etc), there’s no mistaking the idea that these people want total control of the government or at least believe the government must adhere to biblical practices… as interpreted by them and them alone. \\nL207: \\nL208: (The 【43†“Seven Mountains” mandate】 refers to Christians taking over the areas of Religion, Family, Education, Entertainment, Media, Government, and Business in order to influence every aspect of our lives.)\\nL209: \\nL210: This isn’t merely a wishlist. Declaring that the judicial system must “issue rulings that are biblical” effectively undercuts the entire principle of church/state separation. Declaring that evil “carries no power, authority or rights” is frightening when you consider how anything can be declared evil by these people—including abortion care, LGBTQ rights, environmental regulations, etc. And saying they will “operate in unity” is really just a threat against everyone who’s outside the faith. The “Watchman Decree” is nothing less than a rallying cry against anyone who isn’t Christian. \\nL211: \\nL212: Can you imagine the conservative outcry if any other religious group even hinted at anything like this? They would flip out. They would invoke Sharia Law (no matter the religion involved). They would scream about how the country is not a theocracy! But because these are conservative Christians, there’s no similar outcry on the right. Hell, a sitting member of Congress appeared on stage with these people giving her endorsement to their cause!\\nL213: \\nL214: These aren’t some people on the fringe, either. Gene Bailey helps run 【44†Eagle Mountain International Church†www.emic.org】, which is affiliated with 【45†Kenneth Copeland Ministries†www.kcm.org】. Copeland, of course, is arguably the 【46†wealthiest scamvangelist†www.houstonchronicle.com】 in the world. You can tell just by looking at the crowd that we’re not talking about pastors who run churches out of strips malls in random cities; these are the kinds of people who use their wealth to spread Christian propaganda and gain influence.\\nL215: \\nL216: If you’re voting for Republicans at any level, these are the people you’re elevating to positions of power. No matter how many naïve people tell you otherwise, both parties are not the same.\\nL217: \\nL218: The clip in question has been rebuked by 【47†Democrats†twitter.com】 and at least one non-insane 【48†Republican†twitter.com】, but other Republicans welcome this because this is their base. It doesn’t matter who’s in office or how powerful the position is: These Christians want to take over the country, up and down the line, and anyone who’s not on board with their vision will be declared an enemy. \\nL219: \\nL220: The segment was meant to be inspirational. Instead, it’s a nightmare vision of what our country could look like if the wrong people get another chance to run the nation. \\nL221: \\nL222: ### Related\\nL223: \\nL224: Tagged: 【49†Christian nationalism】, 【50†Kenneth Copeland】, 【51†Law】\\nL225: \\nL226: 【34† 】 \\nL227: \\nL228: ##  【34† Hemant Mehta 】 \\nL229: \\nL230: 【52† Mpromptu@gmail.com †mailto:Mpromptu@gmail.com】 \\nL231: \\nL232:   * 【53†twitter†twitter.com】\\nL233: \\nL234: Hemant Mehta is the founder of FriendlyAtheist.com, a YouTube creator, podcast co-host, and author of multiple books about atheism.

You’d get a pretty good idea by watching a clip highlighting the “Watchman Decree” from a recent FlashPoint Live event in Georgia. \n\nOn July 1, a slew of conservative Christians, including conspiracy theorist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and anti-abortion zealot Abby Johnson, gathered to do far more than pray. During the event, host Gene Bailey urged the Christian audience and everyone watching the livestream to join together and recite what he called the “【37†Watchman Decree†flashpoint.govictory.com】.” \n\nWatchmen, in this case, refer to people who pledge to watch over the nation and make sure it’s run according to conservative Christian principles. Writer and activist Nick Knudsen shared the clip that went viral, but you can 【38†see it for yourself at the 1:24:00 mark†flashpoint.govictory.com】 in this video."

Declaring that the judicial system must “issue rulings that are biblical” effectively undercuts the entire principle of church/state separation. Declaring that evil “carries no power, authority or rights” is frightening when you consider how anything can be declared evil by these people—including abortion care, LGBTQ rights, environmental regulations, etc. And saying they will “operate in unity” is really just a threat against everyone who’s outside the faith. The “Watchman Decree” is nothing less than a rallying cry against anyone who isn’t Christian. "

It was notably highlighted during a FlashPoint Live event in Georgia, where conservative Christians, including public figures like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, participated. The decree involves affirmations about ensuring that the U.S. government operates according to conservative Christian principles. The participants declared that the U.S. executive, legislative, and judicial branches should honor God, defend the Constitution, and abide by biblical and constitutional principles. They also emphasized their opposition to \"wokeness,\" the occult, and perceived evil attempts against the nation【15†source】【16†source】.\n\nThe decree includes several key declarations:\n- Taking back \"God-given freedoms\" as per the Constitution.\n- Gaining influence at local community levels.\n- Aiming to control positions of influence and leadership within the \"Seven Mountains\" (religion, family, education, entertainment, media, government, and business).\n- Protecting the nation with the \"blood of Jesus\" and ensuring its strength in various aspects, including spiritual, financial, military, and technological domains【17†source】【18†source】.\n\nThis ideology seeks substantial influence over government and societal functions, effectively challenging the principle of separation of church and state. The \"Seven Mountains\" mandate specifically refers to Christians taking over key societal areas to exert broad influence【19†source】."

You’d get a pretty good idea by watching a clip highlighting the “Watchman Decree” from a recent FlashPoint Live event in Georgia. \\nL171: \\nL172: On July 1, a slew of conservative Christians, including conspiracy theorist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and anti-abortion zealot Abby Johnson, gathered to do far more than pray. During the event, host Gene Bailey urged the Christian audience and everyone watching the livestream to join together and recite what he called the “【37†Watchman Decree†flashpoint.govictory.com】.” \\nL173: \\nL174: Watchmen, in this case, refer to people who pledge to watch over the nation and make sure it’s run according to conservative Christian principles. Writer and activist Nick Knudsen shared the clip that went viral, but you can 【38†see it for yourself at the 1:24:00 mark†flashpoint.govictory.com】 in this video.\\nL175: \\nL176: > Here's a higher quality version of what 【39†@NickKnudsenUS†twitter.com】 shared earlier. 【40†https://t.co/JnLSnJjvzx†t.co】 【41†pic.twitter.com/phGtGrKe7I†t.co】\\nL177: > \\nL178: > — Hemant Mehta (@hemantmehta) 【42†July 15, 2022†twitter.com】\\nL179: \\nL180: After explaining how conservative Christians are “God’s governing Body on the earth” and have “legal power from heaven” to “destroy every attempted advance of the enemy,” they declare the following:\\nL181: \\nL182: > We decree that America’s executive branch of government will honor God and defend the Constitution.\\nL183: > \\nL184: > We decree that our legislative branch (Congress) will write only laws that are righteous and constitutional.\\nL185: > \\nL186: > We decree that our judicial system will issue rulings that are biblical and constitutional.\\nL187: > \\nL188: > We declare that we stand against wokeness, the occult and every evil attempt against our nation.\\nL189: > \\nL190: > We declare and we now take back our God-given freedoms, according to our Constitution.\\nL191: > \\nL192: > We declare that we take back influence at the local level in our communities.\\nL193: > \\nL194: > We decree that we take back and permanently control positions of influence and leadership in each of the *Seven Mountains.\\nL195: > \\nL196: > We decree that the blood of Jesus covers and protects our nation. It protects and separates us for God.\\nL197: > \\nL198: > We declare that our nation is energy independent.\\nL199: > \\nL200: > We declare that America is strong spiritually, financially, militarily and technologically.\\nL201: > \\nL202: > We decree that evil carries no power, authority or rights in our land nor over our people.\\nL203: > \\nL204: > We decree that we will operate in unity, going beyond denominational lines in order to accomplish the purposes of God for our nation.\\nL205: \\nL206: While some of that is just a rehash of conservative talking points (e.g. “wokeness,” “God-given freedoms,” etc), there’s no mistaking the idea that these people want total control of the government or at least believe the government must adhere to biblical practices… as interpreted by them and them alone. \\nL207: \\nL208: (The 【43†“Seven Mountains” mandate】 refers to Christians taking over the areas of Religion, Family, Education, Entertainment, Media, Government, and Business in order to influence every aspect of our lives.)\\nL209: \\nL210: This isn’t merely a wishlist. Declaring that the judicial system must “issue rulings that are biblical” effectively undercuts the entire principle of church/state separation. Declaring that evil “carries no power, authority or rights” is frightening when you consider how anything can be declared evil by these people—including abortion care, LGBTQ rights, environmental regulations, etc. And saying they will “operate in unity” is really just a threat against everyone who’s outside the faith. The “Watchman Decree” is nothing less than a rallying cry against anyone who isn’t Christian. \\nL211: \\nL212: Can you imagine the conservative outcry if any other religious group even hinted at anything like this? They would flip out. They would invoke Sharia Law (no matter the religion involved). They would scream about how the country is not a theocracy! But because these are conservative Christians, there’s no similar outcry on the right. Hell, a sitting member of Congress appeared on stage with these people giving her endorsement to their cause!\\nL213: \\nL214: These aren’t some people on the fringe, either. Gene Bailey helps run 【44†Eagle Mountain International Church†www.emic.org】, which is affiliated with 【45†Kenneth Copeland Ministries†www.kcm.org】. Copeland, of course, is arguably the 【46†wealthiest scamvangelist†www.houstonchronicle.com】 in the world. You can tell just by looking at the crowd that we’re not talking about pastors who run churches out of strips malls in random cities; these are the kinds of people who use their wealth to spread Christian propaganda and gain influence.\\nL215: \\nL216: If you’re voting for Republicans at any level, these are the people you’re elevating to positions of power. No matter how many naïve people tell you otherwise, both parties are not the same.\\nL217: \\nL218: The clip in question has been rebuked by 【47†Democrats†twitter.com】 and at least one non-insane 【48†Republican†twitter.com】, but other Republicans welcome this because this is their base. It doesn’t matter who’s in office or how powerful the position is: These Christians want to take over the country, up and down the line, and anyone who’s not on board with their vision will be declared an enemy. \\nL219: \\nL220: The segment was meant to be inspirational. Instead, it’s a nightmare vision of what our country could look like if the wrong people get another chance to run the nation. \\nL221: \\nL222: ### Related\\nL223: \\nL224: Tagged: 【49†Christian nationalism】, 【50†Kenneth Copeland】, 【51†Law】\\nL225: \\nL226: 【34† 】 \\nL227: \\nL228: ##  【34† Hemant Mehta 】 \\nL229: \\nL230: 【52† Mpromptu@gmail.com †mailto:Mpromptu@gmail.com】 \\nL231: \\nL232:   * 【53†twitter†twitter.com】\\nL233: \\nL234: Hemant Mehta is the founder of FriendlyAtheist.com, a YouTube creator, podcast co-host, and author of multiple books about atheism.

It would seem the answer is yes, if that organization is the 【4†Watchtower Bible and Tract Society】, otherwise known as the Jehovah's Witnesses, and the president is J.F. Rutherford. This is the position clearly taken by the Society regarding Rutherford, their second president, who served from 1917-1942. The Watchtower's recent publication, Jehovah's Witnesses Proclaimers of God's Kingdom, states,\\\"Although Brother Rutherford served for twenty five years as president of the Watchtower Society and devoted all his energy to advancing the work of the organization, he was not the leader of Jehovah's Witnesses, and he did not want to be\\\" (p. 220).\\nL14: \\nL15: Rutherford himself was known to state during public meetings, \\\"If you who are here believe that I am just one of the servants of the Lord, and we are working shoulder to shoulder in unity, serving God and serving 【5†Christ】, say yes\\\" (Ibid., pp. 220-221).\\nL16: \\nL17: This is just another example of 【4†Watchtower】 doublespeak. Typical of Watchtower rhetoric, they hide the truth of the power and authority wielded by the President of the Watchtower Society behind a projection of false humility and servant-hood.\\nL18: \\nL19: The implication here is that the terms \\\"leader\\\" and \\\"servant\\\" are mutually exclusive; if a person is a leader that one cannot be a servant, or if a servant that person cannot be a leader. They appeal to 【6†Scripture】 quoting from the 【4†Jehovah's Witnesses】 New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, \\\"Neither be called 'leaders' for your Leader is one, the 【5†Christ】\\\" (Matthew 23:10). However, putting Matthew 23:10 in context we find: \\\"But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call nor father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven. Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ. But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.\\\"\\nL20: \\nL21: Based upon 【4†Witness】 reasoning, not only was Rutherford not a leader but he also could not have been a teacher, nor could he have been a father. Once again, by filtering the 【6†Scripture】 through Watchtower doctrine, they have missed the point; 【7†Jesus】 does not say we must not be leaders, but rather, in our leading, to be servants, an example for others.\\nL22: \\nL23: ### Watchtower Reasoning\\nL24: \\nL25: Why is the 【4†Watchtower】 splitting hairs over these terms? In their collective mind they now do not have to deal with any evidence of false prophecy, easily brushing aside any seeming error as a misunderstanding by one who himself was admittedly not a leader. Are the Witnesses being honest? What does one find when looking beyond the 【4†Witnesses】 interpretation of a leader to how 【6†Scripture】 uses this word? According to Vine's Expository Dictionary of Biblical Words, the Hebrew word sar translated \\\"official; leader; commander; captain; chief; prince; ruler\\\" appears about 420 times in the Hebrew scriptures. Certainly this would indicate that the inspired writers of the Old Testament did not have a problem with the term.\\nL26: \\nL27: Quoting from Vine's, \\\"In several passages, sar refers to the task of 'ruling.'\\\" Moses tried to break up a fight between two Hebrews and one of them asked him, \\\"Who made thee a prince and a judge over us?\\\" (Exodus 2:1). In such a context, sar means \\\"leader,\\\" \\\"ruler,\\\" and \\\"judge\\\": \\\"Moreover thou shalt provide out of all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them, to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens (Exodus 18:21). Certainly a 【4†Jehovah's Witness】 would agree that this passage would be a good description of the men who serve on the governing body of the Watchtower Society. The Greek word hodegeo used in the New Testament means \\\"to lead the way\\\" and is used literally as \\\"guide\\\"; (KJV, \\\"lead\\\"), as\\\"guiding\\\" the blind (Matthew 15:14; Luke 6:39); as \\\"guiding\\\" unto fountains of waters of life (Revelation 7:17); and figuratively (John 16:13), of \\\"guidance\\\" into the truth, by the Holy Spirit, of the interpretation of Scripture (Acts 8:31) (Vine's).\\nL28: \\nL29: Here again, this would describe the work of the governing body. In speaking of the \\\"faithful discreet slave class,\\\" from which come the members of the 【4†Jehovah's Witnesses】 Governing body, the Watchtower publication Qualified to be Ministers states, \\\"But since the Lord's return, their responsibilities have been enlarged. The 'slave' class has been appointed over all the Master's belongings here on earth\\\" (p.381). The Proclaimers book states, \\\"Even as the congregations in the first century recognized the governing body in Jerusalem, so today the congregations would not prosper spiritually without central supervision\\\" (p. 219).\\nL30: \\nL31: The appeal the 【4†Society】 makes for the Jerusalem Council being the very basis for the Watchtower Governing body makes their claim to not be leaders all the more ludicrous. Were these men in the early Church, to which they compare themselves, not leaders? Can anyone giving an honest reading to 【6†Scripture】 imagine James, Peter or Paul standing before the church and saying, \\\"I am an apostle but I am not a leader\\\"? Of course not.\\nL32: \\nL33: While the book provides a large amount of history for all the 【4†Society's】 Presidents, it is only of Rutherford that such great detail is given to his not being a leader. Why is this the case? The answer seems to lie in the fact that many Witnesses, when confronted with the false prophecies of the Rutherford years, are responding by stating he was never, and never claimed to be, the leader of the Jehovah's Witnesses. The Witness then usually states that although he was president of the Society, Rutherford was just a Bible student studying with others. As proof, the Proclaimers book is brought out or referenced to substantiate that Rutherford himself claimed he was not the Watchtower leader but simply a servant.\\nL34: \\nL35: Rather than examine this revisionist history put forth by the Proclaimers book, a closer look should be given as to how contemporaries of Rutherford viewed him. The following excerpt was taken from an article written by Olin R. Moyle, former counsel for the 【4†Witnesses】, who was expelled from the Jehovah's Witnesses just two months after publication of this article. It should be pointed out that he was not expelled for anything in this article, but rather for writing a letter to Rutherford calling him to task for unseemly behavior and treatment of the members at Bethel, the Jehovah's Witsses' headquarters. Moyle wrote: \\\"Judge J.F. Rutherford, a former Missouri attorney, is the visible director of the Jehovah's Witnesses. He doesn't claim to be a prophet nor does he fit the ordinary idea of a prophet... Some years ago he gave up his law practice to use all his time in proclaiming the 'Kingdom message'. His writings have reached the tremendous circulation of two hundred seventy nine million, a record unequaled by any publication except the Bible.... He is the chief contributor to the Watchtower, a semi-monthly periodical, and oversees the activities of the organization from one end of the earth to the other\\\" (Fact Digest, June 1939, Vol. VIII, No. 2).\\nL36: \\nL37: ### Just Another False Prophet\\nL38: \\nL39: Two points must be noted: First, \\\"he doesn't claim to be a prophet nor does he fit the ordinary idea of a prophet,\\\" and second, \\\"he...oversees the activities of the organization from one end of the earth to the other.\\\" Certainly Rutherford does not fit the definition of a true prophet, but what about a 【8†false prophet】? Examine the following statements written by Rutherford in 【4†Watchtower】 publications:\\nL40: \\nL41: \\\"The second presence of the Lord began in 1874\\\" (Prophecy, p. 65).\\nL42: \\nL43: \\\"We may confidently expect that 1925 will bring the return of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and the prophets of old...\\\" (Millions Now Living Will Never Die, pp. 89, 90). \\\"We should expect Abel, Enoch, Noah etc. shortly after 1925...\\\" (The Way to Paradise, p. 224).\\nL44: \\nL45: \\\"The year 1925 is here. With great expectation 【9†Christians】 have looked forward to this year. Many have confidently looked forward to this year. Many have confidently expected that all members of the body of 【5†Christ】 will be changed to heavenly glory during this year\\\" (The Watchtower, 1 January 1925, p. 3).\\nL46: \\nL47: \\\"All we predicted did not come to pass, but Armageddon is now at hand\\\" (Vindication, Book One, pp. 146, 147). \\\"The Kingdom is here, Armageddon is just ahead\\\" (The Messenger, 1 September 1940, p. 6).\\nL48: \\nL49: Does Rutherford meet the test of a prophet? Was he guilty of 【8†false prophecy】? Let the Watchtower speak for itself:\\nL50: \\nL51: \\\"True, there have been those in times past who predicted an 'end to the world', even announcing a specific date.... Yet, nothing happened. The end did not come. They were guilty of false prophesying\\\" (Awake!, 8 October 1968, p. 23).\\nL52: \\nL53: \\\"But it may be asked, how are we to know whether one is a true or false prophet? If he is a true prophet his message will come to pass exactly as prophesied. If he is a false prophet, his prophecy will fail to come to pass.... The difference between a true and a false prophet is that the one is speaking the word of the Lord and the other is speaking his own dreams and guesses\\\" (The Watchtower, 15 May 1930, pp. 154, 155).\\nL54: \\nL55: This last quote is particularly telling as it was published during Rutherford's presidency. Certainly, by examining Rutherford's predictions using their own writings, one must conclude he was a 【8†false prophet】. The second point made by Moyle's article also must be considered by 【4†Witness】 and non-Witness alike. Rutherford was clearly viewed as \\\"overseeing the organization's activities from one end of the earth to the other.\\\" Can the Witnesses today honestly say that a man can be designated as the overseer of such a broad territory as the entire earth and still not be considered a leader?\\nL56: \\nL57: Why must the 【4†Watchtower】 continue to put forth such baseless and irrational teachings to its members? This is nothing more than another of the many teachings designed by the Governing Body to control their \\\"followers,\\\" using Watchtower instructions to manipulate them so they cannot think for themselves. The facts are clear, the evidence irrefutable: J.F. Rutherford was a leader, despite the assertions by the Proclaimers book.\\nL58: \\nL59: The Governing Body may continue to deceive the 【4†Witnesses】 with their false claim of not being leaders, but they cannot deceive 【5†Christ】. There is no question from 【6†Scripture】 that 【7†Jesus】 views them as leaders and would say of them, \\\"they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch\\\" (Matthew 15:12-14).\\nL60: \\nL61:   Search\\nL62: \\nL63: ### Articles & More\\nL64: \\nL65:   * 【10†About Us】\\nL66:   * 【11†Free Newsletter】\\nL67:   * 【12†Index of Cults and Religions】\\nL68:   * 【13†Fast Facts】\\nL69:   * 【14†Profiles】\\nL70:   * 【15†Articles】\\nL71:   * 【16†Pastors】\\nL72:   * 【17†Popular Messages】\\nL73:   * 【18†More Comments about Watchman Fellowship】\\nL74:   * 【19†Contact Us】\\nL75:   * 【20†Site Map】\\nL76:   * 【21†Resources Catalog】\\nL77:     * 【22†Free Profile Subscription】\\nL78:     * 【21†Watchman Fellowship Resources】\\nL79:     * 【23†Mormonism】\\nL80:     * 【24†Jehovah's Witnesses】\\nL81:     * 【25†Cults & Alternative Religions】\\nL82:     * 【26†Islam and World Religions】\\nL83:     * 【27†Occult】\\nL84:     * 【28†New Age】\\nL85:     * 【29†Seventh-day Adventism Sabbatarianism】\\nL86:     * 【30†General Topics & Doctrine】\\nL87:     * 【31†Make A Donation】\\nL88:     * 【32†Atheism】\\nL89:     * 【33†School of Apologetics】\\nL90:     * 【34†Greer Heard】\\nL91: \\nL92:  【0†cult awareness by watchman fellowship】\\nL93: \\nL94:   * 【10†about us】\\nL95:   * 【15†articles】\\nL96:   * 【35†blog】\\nL97:   * 【21†resources catalog】\\nL98:   * 【36†donate】\\nL99:   * 【11†free newsletter】\\nL100:   * 【19†contact us】\\nL101: \\nL102: 【0†home】【37†cart】\\nL103: \\nL104: 【10†About Us】 |  【15†Articles】 | 【21†Resources Catalog】 | 【36†Donate】 | 【11†Free Newsletter】 | 【19†Contact Us】\\nVisible: 0% - 100%\", \"summary\": \"The Watchtower - An Organization without Leaders | Watchman Fellowship, Inc.

You’d get a pretty good idea by watching a clip highlighting the “Watchman Decree” from a recent FlashPoint Live event in Georgia. \\nL171: \\nL172: On July 1, a slew of conservative Christians, including conspiracy theorist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and anti-abortion zealot Abby Johnson, gathered to do far more than pray. During the event, host Gene Bailey urged the Christian audience and everyone watching the livestream to join together and recite what he called the “【37†Watchman Decree†flashpoint.govictory.com】.” \\nL173: \\nL174: Watchmen, in this case, refer to people who pledge to watch over the nation and make sure it’s run according to conservative Christian principles. Writer and activist Nick Knudsen shared the clip that went viral, but you can 【38†see it for yourself at the 1:24:00 mark†flashpoint.govictory.com】 in this video.\\nL175: \\nL176: > Here's a higher quality version of what 【39†@NickKnudsenUS†twitter.com】 shared earlier. 【40†https://t.co/JnLSnJjvzx†t.co】 【41†pic.twitter.com/phGtGrKe7I†t.co】\\nL177: > \\nL178: > — Hemant Mehta (@hemantmehta) 【42†July 15, 2022†twitter.com】\\nL179: \\nL180: After explaining how conservative Christians are “God’s governing Body on the earth” and have “legal power from heaven” to “destroy every attempted advance of the enemy,” they declare the following:\\nL181: \\nL182: > We decree that America’s executive branch of government will honor God and defend the Constitution.\\nL183: > \\nL184: > We decree that our legislative branch (Congress) will write only laws that are righteous and constitutional.\\nL185: > \\nL186: > We decree that our judicial system will issue rulings that are biblical and constitutional.\\nL187: > \\nL188: > We declare that we stand against wokeness, the occult and every evil attempt against our nation.\\nL189: > \\nL190: > We declare and we now take back our God-given freedoms, according to our Constitution.\\nL191: > \\nL192: > We declare that we take back influence at the local level in our communities.\\nL193: > \\nL194: > We decree that we take back and permanently control positions of influence and leadership in each of the *Seven Mountains.\\nL195: > \\nL196: > We decree that the blood of Jesus covers and protects our nation. It protects and separates us for God.\\nL197: > \\nL198: > We declare that our nation is energy independent.\\nL199: > \\nL200: > We declare that America is strong spiritually, financially, militarily and technologically.\\nL201: > \\nL202: > We decree that evil carries no power, authority or rights in our land nor over our people.\\nL203: > \\nL204: > We decree that we will operate in unity, going beyond denominational lines in order to accomplish the purposes of God for our nation.\\nL205: \\nL206: While some of that is just a rehash of conservative talking points (e.g. “wokeness,” “God-given freedoms,” etc), there’s no mistaking the idea that these people want total control of the government or at least believe the government must adhere to biblical practices… as interpreted by them and them alone. \\nL207: \\nL208: (The 【43†“Seven Mountains” mandate】 refers to Christians taking over the areas of Religion, Family, Education, Entertainment, Media, Government, and Business in order to influence every aspect of our lives.)\\nL209: \\nL210: This isn’t merely a wishlist. Declaring that the judicial system must “issue rulings that are biblical” effectively undercuts the entire principle of church/state separation. Declaring that evil “carries no power, authority or rights” is frightening when you consider how anything can be declared evil by these people—including abortion care, LGBTQ rights, environmental regulations, etc. And saying they will “operate in unity” is really just a threat against everyone who’s outside the faith. The “Watchman Decree” is nothing less than a rallying cry against anyone who isn’t Christian. \\nL211: \\nL212: Can you imagine the conservative outcry if any other religious group even hinted at anything like this? They would flip out. They would invoke Sharia Law (no matter the religion involved). They would scream about how the country is not a theocracy! But because these are conservative Christians, there’s no similar outcry on the right. Hell, a sitting member of Congress appeared on stage with these people giving her endorsement to their cause!\\nL213: \\nL214: These aren’t some people on the fringe, either. Gene Bailey helps run 【44†Eagle Mountain International Church†www.emic.org】, which is affiliated with 【45†Kenneth Copeland Ministries†www.kcm.org】. Copeland, of course, is arguably the 【46†wealthiest scamvangelist†www.houstonchronicle.com】 in the world. You can tell just by looking at the crowd that we’re not talking about pastors who run churches out of strips malls in random cities; these are the kinds of people who use their wealth to spread Christian propaganda and gain influence.\\nL215: \\nL216: If you’re voting for Republicans at any level, these are the people you’re elevating to positions of power. No matter how many naïve people tell you otherwise, both parties are not the same.\\nL217: \\nL218: The clip in question has been rebuked by 【47†Democrats†twitter.com】 and at least one non-insane 【48†Republican†twitter.com】, but other Republicans welcome this because this is their base. It doesn’t matter who’s in office or how powerful the position is: These Christians want to take over the country, up and down the line, and anyone who’s not on board with their vision will be declared an enemy. \\nL219: \\nL220: The segment was meant to be inspirational. Instead, it’s a nightmare vision of what our country could look like if the wrong people get another chance to run the nation. \\nL221: \\nL222: ### Related\\nL223: \\nL224: Tagged: 【49†Christian nationalism】, 【50†Kenneth Copeland】, 【51†Law】\\nL225: \\nL226: 【34† 】 \\nL227: \\nL228: ##  【34† Hemant Mehta 】 \\nL229: \\nL230: 【52† Mpromptu@gmail.com †mailto:Mpromptu@gmail.com】 \\nL231: \\nL232:   * 【53†twitter†twitter.com】\\nL233: \\nL234: Hemant Mehta is the founder of FriendlyAtheist.com, a YouTube creator, podcast co-host, and author of multiple books about atheism.

You’d get a pretty good idea by watching a clip highlighting the “Watchman Decree” from a recent FlashPoint Live event in Georgia. \\nL171: \\nL172: On July 1, a slew of conservative Christians, including conspiracy theorist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and anti-abortion zealot Abby Johnson, gathered to do far more than pray. During the event, host Gene Bailey urged the Christian audience and everyone watching the livestream to join together and recite what he called the “【37†Watchman Decree†flashpoint.govictory.com】.” \\nL173: \\nL174: Watchmen, in this case, refer to people who pledge to watch over the nation and make sure it’s run according to conservative Christian principles. Writer and activist Nick Knudsen shared the clip that went viral, but you can 【38†see it for yourself at the 1:24:00 mark†flashpoint.govictory.com】 in this video.\\nL175: \\nL176: > Here's a higher quality version of what 【39†@NickKnudsenUS†twitter.com】 shared earlier. 【40†https://t.co/JnLSnJjvzx†t.co】 【41†pic.twitter.com/phGtGrKe7I†t.co】\\nL177: > \\nL178: > — Hemant Mehta (@hemantmehta) 【42†July 15, 2022†twitter.com】\\nL179: \\nL180: After explaining how conservative Christians are “God’s governing Body on the earth” and have “legal power from heaven” to “destroy every attempted advance of the enemy,” they declare the following:\\nL181: \\nL182: > We decree that America’s executive branch of government will honor God and defend the Constitution.\\nL183: > \\nL184: > We decree that our legislative branch (Congress) will write only laws that are righteous and constitutional.\\nL185: > \\nL186: > We decree that our judicial system will issue rulings that are biblical and constitutional.\\nL187: > \\nL188: > We declare that we stand against wokeness, the occult and every evil attempt against our nation.\\nL189: > \\nL190: > We declare and we now take back our God-given freedoms, according to our Constitution.\\nL191: > \\nL192: > We declare that we take back influence at the local level in our communities.\\nL193: > \\nL194: > We decree that we take back and permanently control positions of influence and leadership in each of the *Seven Mountains.\\nL195: > \\nL196: > We decree that the blood of Jesus covers and protects our nation. It protects and separates us for God.\\nL197: > \\nL198: > We declare that our nation is energy independent.\\nL199: > \\nL200: > We declare that America is strong spiritually, financially, militarily and technologically.\\nL201: > \\nL202: > We decree that evil carries no power, authority or rights in our land nor over our people.\\nL203: > \\nL204: > We decree that we will operate in unity, going beyond denominational lines in order to accomplish the purposes of God for our nation.\\nL205: \\nL206: While some of that is just a rehash of conservative talking points (e.g. “wokeness,” “God-given freedoms,” etc), there’s no mistaking the idea that these people want total control of the government or at least believe the government must adhere to biblical practices… as interpreted by them and them alone. \\nL207: \\nL208: (The 【43†“Seven Mountains” mandate】 refers to Christians taking over the areas of Religion, Family, Education, Entertainment, Media, Government, and Business in order to influence every aspect of our lives.)\\nL209: \\nL210: This isn’t merely a wishlist. Declaring that the judicial system must “issue rulings that are biblical” effectively undercuts the entire principle of church/state separation. Declaring that evil “carries no power, authority or rights” is frightening when you consider how anything can be declared evil by these people—including abortion care, LGBTQ rights, environmental regulations, etc. And saying they will “operate in unity” is really just a threat against everyone who’s outside the faith. The “Watchman Decree” is nothing less than a rallying cry against anyone who isn’t Christian. \\nL211: \\nL212: Can you imagine the conservative outcry if any other religious group even hinted at anything like this? They would flip out. They would invoke Sharia Law (no matter the religion involved). They would scream about how the country is not a theocracy! But because these are conservative Christians, there’s no similar outcry on the right. Hell, a sitting member of Congress appeared on stage with these people giving her endorsement to their cause!\\nL213: \\nL214: These aren’t some people on the fringe, either. Gene Bailey helps run 【44†Eagle Mountain International Church†www.emic.org】, which is affiliated with 【45†Kenneth Copeland Ministries†www.kcm.org】. Copeland, of course, is arguably the 【46†wealthiest scamvangelist†www.houstonchronicle.com】 in the world. You can tell just by looking at the crowd that we’re not talking about pastors who run churches out of strips malls in random cities; these are the kinds of people who use their wealth to spread Christian propaganda and gain influence.\\nL215: \\nL216: If you’re voting for Republicans at any level, these are the people you’re elevating to positions of power. No matter how many naïve people tell you otherwise, both parties are not the same.\\nL217: \\nL218: The clip in question has been rebuked by 【47†Democrats†twitter.com】 and at least one non-insane 【48†Republican†twitter.com】, but other Republicans welcome this because this is their base. It doesn’t matter who’s in office or how powerful the position is: These Christians want to take over the country, up and down the line, and anyone who’s not on board with their vision will be declared an enemy. \\nL219: \\nL220: The segment was meant to be inspirational. Instead, it’s a nightmare vision of what our country could look like if the wrong people get another chance to run the nation. \\nL221: \\nL222: ### Related\\nL223: \\nL224: Tagged: 【49†Christian nationalism】, 【50†Kenneth Copeland】, 【51†Law】\\nL225: \\nL226: 【34† 】 \\nL227: \\nL228: ##  【34† Hemant Mehta 】 \\nL229: \\nL230: 【52† Mpromptu@gmail.com †mailto:Mpromptu@gmail.com】 \\nL231: \\nL232:   * 【53†twitter†twitter.com】\\nL233: \\nL234: Hemant Mehta is the founder of FriendlyAtheist.com, a YouTube creator, podcast co-host, and author of multiple books about atheism.

The movement is characterized by its ideological stance rather than a structured organizational framework. Key figures like Kenneth Copeland have been identified as influential within this movement, but specifics on the organizational structure or governance model are not clearly outlined in the sources I reviewed.\n\nI apologize for not being able to find more detailed information on how this group operates or defines its structure as a governing body. For a more comprehensive understanding, it may be beneficial to explore additional resources or expert analyses that delve into the internal workings and organizational dynamics of the Watchman Decree movement."

          "content": "Dominionism is a theological belief and political movement among some Christians, particularly in the United States. It advocates for Christians to take control over various aspects of society and government, often motivated by the belief that this is a mandate from God. The term \"dominion\" refers to the idea of Christians gaining authority or dominion over society, based on an interpretation of the first chapter of Genesis, where God grants humans dominion over the earth.\n\nKey aspects of Dominionism include:\n- **Theocratic Ideals**: Advocating for laws and government policies to reflect Christian teachings and morals.\n- **Influence in Society**: Seeking to influence or control key areas of society like politics, education, media, and entertainment, often in line with the \"Seven Mountains\" mandate, which involves Christians being influential in seven key spheres of society (religion, family, education, government, media, arts & entertainment, and business).\n- **Active Political Engagement**: Many dominionists are actively involved in politics, supporting candidates and policies that align with their beliefs.\n\nDominionism overlaps with Christian Reconstructionism and some forms of evangelicalism, but it's important to note that not all evangelicals are dominionists. It represents a specific subset of Christian thought and is considered controversial, both within and outside Christian communities, particularly due to its stance on church-state separation and religious pluralism.\n\nThe movement has been influential in certain political and social circles, often intertwining with conservative politics, but it does not represent the beliefs or practices of all Christians."

Mike Johnson of Louisiana as Speaker of the House. Johnson brings to the office some of the most extreme hard-right views in Congress on immigration and LGBTQ+ rights.\\nL85: \\nL86: Johnson now serves in one of the most powerful positions in the federal government and is second in the line of presidential succession. Given his fringe public statements and positions, it is not surprising that hate groups and extremists have rushed to praise the new speaker.\\nL87: \\nL88: ## \\nL89: \\nL90: [Image 1: Mike Johnson takes oath]  \\nL91: \\nL92: Newly elected Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., takes the oath in the House chambers as members of the House of Representatives gather at the U.S. Capitol to vote on Oct. 25, 2023, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\\nL93: \\nL94: Johnson rode Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” wave in 2016, coming into office at the same time as the former president. Known as “MAGA Mike” by fellow Republicans, Johnson aligned with Trump’s hard-right agenda and reportedly was 【57† a leader in rallying congressional†apnews.com】 support for conspiracy theories related to the 2020 presidential election. Trump congratulated Johnson on his new speakership last week.\\nL95: \\nL96: Hatewatch reached out to Johnson via his communications director Corinne Day over email but did not receive a response.\\nL97: \\nL98: ## Anti-immigrant hate group on Johnson: 'No need to guess where he stands on immigration'\\nL99: \\nL100: In his tenure as a congressman, Johnson has pushed xenophobic rhetoric and policies. His elevation to the speaker’s chair was lauded by anti-immigrant hate groups. Some of Johnson’s statements on immigration mimic 【58†“great replacement”】-style rhetoric. The “great replacement” is a false and 【58† racist conspiracy theory】 purporting that white people are being intentionally displaced by ‘elites’ and replaced by immigrant people of color.\\nL101: \\nL102: Johnson has repeatedly accused Democrats of encouraging immigration to secure a supportive voting base. In a July 2021 【59† appearance†www.youtube.com】 on Fox News, Johnson accused the Biden administration of allowing migrants into the country to expand the party’s voting base.\\nL103: \\nL104: “Why in the world would any elected official in this country go along with this terrible policy? This dangerous set of policies that they’re engaging in? You’re always drawn to that ultimate conclusion: They want to turn these people into voters,” Johnson said.\\nL105: \\nL106: Johnson repeated a similar argument during a July 2022 episode of his podcast “Truth Be Told,” which Johnson hosts with his wife, Kelly. He described the Democrats’ “ultimate objective” as being “to turn illegal aliens into Democrat voters.” In a 【60† hearing†americasvoice.org】 later that same month with U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, Johnson said, “We have a literal invasion of lawless masses flooding over our border from more than 160 countries.”\\nL107: \\nL108: Racial justice and civil rights organizations have been clear in their concern over politicians who spread this false conspiracy. Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) wrote in their “From Scarcity to Solidarity” guide that the “great replacement” conspiracy theory takes for granted two racist assumptions based in a scarcity mentality: 1) that the United States should be run by white people and 2) that white people must be in a numerical majority to thrive. The guide states that this assumption “does not hold space for white people – for white Christians – to have shared belonging and democratic participation with people of other races or religions.”\\nL109: \\nL110: Vanessa Cardenas, the executive director of America’s Voice Education Fund, told reporters in August, “When elected officials amplify dangerous rhetoric like the white nationalist invasion and replacement conspiracy theories, they create a climate that fosters political violence.”\\nL111: \\nL112: Johnson’s comments about immigrants are not limited to repeating the false conspiracy; he has also 【61† spoken out†mikejohnson.house.gov】 against the rollback of the Trump-era Title 42 policy, which was used to deport potential asylum-seekers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nL113: \\nL114: After the Biden administration tried to phase out Title 42 in spring 2022, Johnson filed an amicus brief in support of a Republican-led lawsuit blocking the measure. In a statement about the lawsuit, Johnson 【62† claimed†mikejohnson.house.gov】 Biden is “intentionally allowing the destruction of our country.”\\nL115: \\nL116: In 2021, Johnson 【63† spoke at an panel discussion†archive.ph】 organized by the 【64† Center for Immigration Studies】 (CIS), an SPLC-designated anti-immigrant hate group. CIS is known for producing reports warning of the dangers of mass immigration and making claims of elevated levels of criminality of immigrants that have been debunked elsewhere. The group also 【65† considers】 white nationalist talking points to be part of the immigration debate and has 【66† promoted white nationalist websites】, such as 【67† VDARE.com】, in their online newsletter. CIS approved of Johnson’s election as speaker, writing in an Oct. 25 post on their website, “No need to guess where he stands on immigration – he appeared at a Center panel discussion in October 2021.”\\nL117: \\nL118: During the panel, Johnson thanked CIS’s longtime executive director Mark Krikorian for having him and endorsed the hate group, saying, “It’s just such important work that you all are doing right now.”\\nL119: \\nL120: ## \\nL121: \\nL122: [Image 2: Mark Krikorian]  \\nL123: \\nL124: Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies speaks in his office in 2013 in Washington, D.C.(Photo by Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\\nL125: \\nL126: Krikorian claims Haiti is “so screwed up because it wasn’t colonized long enough” and that the U.S. needs immigration control and enforcement because one cannot “distinguish between” a “Guatemalan dishwasher” and an “ISIS suicide bomber.”\\nL127: \\nL128: Hatewatch reached out to Krikorian over email, but he declined to answer questions about Johnson’s involvement in the event.\\nL129: \\nL130: Johnson engaged in xenophobic rhetoric during the event. Speaking about migrants being relocated to his hometown of Shreveport, Louisiana, he said:\\nL131: \\nL132: > I get a long list of names that I cannot pronounce from countries all over the world that just, hey, heads up, they’re coming to your town. There’s nothing I can do about it because we’re in the minority party. And this goes on and on and on, and it seems to be intentional. They’re dropping these people off in midsized cities all over the South and all over the country.\\nL133: \\nL134: Elsewhere in his remarks, Johnson claimed that if immigrants did not fit into his ideas of assimilation, the nation and its alleged identity would face destruction. “Sound immigration policy is you allow us to maintain our identity as a nation-state,” he stated.\\nL135: \\nL136: He veered into xenophobic territory again, adding, “Our legal system allows for people to come here and assimilate to who we are, not to flood this nation and make it into nothing or all things, because then we’re no longer the United States of America.”\\nL137: \\nL138: CIS’s sister organization, the 【68† Federation for American Immigration Reform】 (FAIR), another SPLC-designated hate group, also lauded Johnson’s election to speaker. The group 【69† issued †archive.ph】 a press release congratulating Johnson and urging him in his new role to demand that a draconian, FAIR-approved immigration resolution be incorporated into any spending or foreign aid package sent to President Biden.\\nL139: \\nL140: Hatewatch reached out to FAIR via email for comment but did not hear back before publication.\\nL141: \\nL142: ## Johnson called ‘courageous leader’ after decades as an anti-LGBTQ+ hate crusader\\nL143: \\nL144: ## \\nL145: \\nL146: [Image 3: Kristen Waggoner]  \\nL147: \\nL148: Lawyer Kristen Waggoner of Alliance Defending Freedom speaks outside the U.S. Supreme Court Building on Dec. 5, 2022, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\\nL149: \\nL150: Prior to being elected to Congress, Johnson worked for two decades as an attorney for 【70† Alliance Defending Freedom】 (ADF), an anti-LGBTQ+ hate group that claims to fight the “homosexual agenda” and identifies as a Christian organization since its founding by Christian right leaders including James Dobson, Bill Bright, D. James Kennedy and Alan Sears.\\nL151: \\nL152: After Johnson’s elevation to the speakership, CNN 【71† reported†www.cnn.com】 on a series of little-known anti-LGBTQ+ op-eds Johnson penned in the early-mid 2000s for his local newspaper in Shreveport, Louisiana. Reacting to the 2003 Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas, the decision that declared it unconstitutional for states to criminalize gay sex between consenting adults, Johnson 【72† wrote†www.newspapers.com】 that states have “many legitimate grounds to proscribe same-sex deviate [sic] sexual intercourse, including public health … safety, morals and the promotion of healthy marriages.”\\nL153: \\nL154: In 【73† another op-ed†www.newspapers.com】 the following year, Johnson wrote, “Homosexual relationships are inherently unnatural and … are ultimately harmful and costly for everyone.” In the same essay, he wrote that same-sex marriage would “place our entire democratic system in jeopardy by eroding its foundation.” These arguments, which paint LGBTQ+ people as deviant, pestilent and dangerous and try to legislate them back into the closet, are hallmarks of the anti-LGBTQ+ hate ideology.\\nL155: \\nL156: In 2005, Johnson and ADF (known then as Alliance Defense Fund) organized a protest against an initiative aiming to counter anti-gay bias in schools in which he 【74† told reporters,†www.nbcnews.com】 “You can call [homosexuality] sinful or destructive – ultimately it’s both.” In his role at ADF, Johnson also pushed for a federal ban on gay marriage and fought extending benefits to partners of city employees who are in same-sex relationships.\\nL157: \\nL158: ADF congratulated Johnson on 【75† social media†archive.ph】, calling him a “courageous leader.”\\nL159: \\nL160: A spokesperson for ADF confirmed to Hatewatch that Johnson worked for the group from November 2002 to July 2010.\\nL161: \\nL162: ## \\nL163: \\nL164: [Image 4: Donald Trump and Tony Perkins]  \\nL165: \\nL166: Former U.S. President and current Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump (left) stands with Family Research Council president Tony Perkins at the Pray Vote Stand Summit in Washington, D.C., on Sept. 15, 2023. (Photo by Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)   \\nL167: \\nL168: Another hate group celebrated Johnson’s win. Tony Perkins, head of the anti-LGBTQ+ 【76† Family Research Council】, appeared on the conservative outlet Newsmax to applaud the new speaker. Newsmax introduced Perkins as a “very close friend” of Johnson. Perkins confirmed their relationship, saying he has known the new speaker for 25 years. “I’m so proud of Mike,” he said. Perkins also said he believed Johnson’s “sense of “confidence and peace and tranquility,” as well as his reputation as “a nice guy” will help him get things done in Congress. “It's going to be a new day,” Perkins said. He said Johnson told him a similar thing the morning of Oct. 25.\\nL169: \\nL170: “I was talking to him as he was working on his speech,” Perkins said. “He said, ‘It’s a new day.’”\\nL171: \\nL172: Hatewatch reached out to Perkins via email about his relationship with Johnson but did not receive a reply.\\nL173: \\nL174: ## A commitment to Christian nationalism and a ‘biblical’ republic\\nL175: \\nL176: While Family Research Council is legally 【77† organized†www.propublica.org】 as an association of churches, it acts as the political activist arm and policy shop for the Christian religious right and infuses Christian dominionist and Christian nationalist ideas into policy materials and event content.\\nL177: \\nL178: Political Research Associates’ Fredrick Clarkson has described dominionism as the “theocratic idea that Christians are called by God to exercise dominion over every aspect of society by taking control of political and cultural institutions.” Similarly, Anthea Butler, professor of religious studies and Africana studies at the University of Pennsylvania, describes Christian nationalism as the idea that America is a Christian nation and that its leaders should be Christian.\\nL179: \\nL180: In op-eds, podcasts and various public appearances, Johnson has repeatedly presented the United States as irrevocably rooted in an ultra-conservative Christian “biblical” worldview. The concept of a biblical world view is foundational to both Christian nationalist and dominionist thinking and movements. During a 2013 appearance at a forum hosted by Louisiana Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, Johnson called for a revival of “18th-century values.” In footage 【78† reviewed and reported on by The Guardian this October†www.theguardian.com】, Johnson described Christians as “inherently intolerant” due to their rejection of “postmodern culture.”\\nL181: \\nL182: Most recently, Johnson echoed some of the ideas of anti-LGBTQ+ and historical revisionist 【79† David Barton】. When attending an event of Barton’s WallBuilders organization, Johnson shared his long admiration of Barton and later said he had a profound influence on his work. Johnson articulated the idea that infusing Christian religion into government is necessary for ensuring the health of American governance and civil society. During a Sept. 28, 2022, episode of his podcast “Truth Be Told,” Johnson said:\\nL183: \\nL184: > See, the founders understood that all men are fallen and that power corrupts. And they also knew that no amount of institutional checks and balances or decentralization of power and civil authorities would be sufficient to maintain a just government if the men in charge had no fear of eternal judgment by a power higher than their temporal institutions. So a free society and a healthy Republic depend upon religious and moral virtue.\\nL185: \\nL186: “Without those virtues being indispensably supported by religion and morality, as Washington said, every nation will ultimately fall,” Johnson said, paraphrasing George Washington’s farewell address. Again, Johnson mimics Barton’s tactics of proof texting, a method in Biblical scholarship that uses quotes out of context to make one’s point, to claim the founders of the U.S. did not intend for the separation of church and state. Barton also has a long and serious track record of misusing quotations, statistics and sources to push religious nationalism.\\nL187: \\nL188: During a 【80† taped interview†twitter.com】 that has circulated widely after his election to the speakership, Johnson described democracy as “two wolves and a lamb deciding what’s for dinner.” He made a broad overstatement about the founding of the U.S. under a specifically Christian framework, continuing: “It’s not just majority rule. It’s a constitutional republic. And the founders set that up because they followed the biblical admonition on what a civil society is supposed to look like.”\\nL189: \\nL190: Johnson has presented Christians as simultaneously the rightful inheritors of American constitutional government and a victimized underclass besieged by modern pluralism. In a roughly half-hour video discussing a lawsuit that Johnson filed in 2015 on behalf of Answers in Genesis, a conservative Christian organization that promotes the belief that modern evolutionary science is a lie, Johnson claimed, “If you’re a Christian organization, you get treated like a second-class citizen.”\\nL191: \\nL192: In another 2015 interview with Answers in Genesis leader Ken Ham, Johnson described Ham’s group as victims of “viewpoint discrimination” after the Christian organization was unable to access public tax dollars to build their religious-themed amusement park until committing to refraining from using religious belief in their hiring processes.\\nL193: \\nL194: Johnson represents, for many who study religious nationalism and religion’s role in social and political movements, the epitome of politically extreme conservative Christians. Matthew Taylor at the Institute for Islamic-Christian-Jewish Studies 【81† notes†plus.thebulwark.com】 that there are “principled, conservative Christians with heartfelt moral views on abortion, LGBTQ-rights, and a host of other cultural issues who value democracy and pluralism and recognize their preferred policies won’t always win the day.” Taylor contrasts this with the fact that there are politically extreme conservative Christians who might hold the exact same views on the same issues, “but who are also willing to upend democracy to see their agendas realized.”\\nL195: \\nL196: In Taylor’s view, these politically extreme conservative Christians use theology to justify their own authoritarianism. Taylor says, “Mike Johnson can be located in this group.”\\nL197: \\nL198: Politico 【82† reported†www.politico.com】 Oct. 25 that on Jan. 5, 2021, Johnson told members of his Republican caucus: “All of us have prayed for God’s discernment. I know I’ve prayed for each of you individually,” before pressing them to oppose the legitimate election results at the now-infamous vote certification of President Biden the next day.\\nL199: \\nL200: Joseph Wiinikka-Lydon contributed to this reporting.\\nL201: \\nL202: Photo illustration by SPLC\\nL203: \\nL204: Comments, suggestions or tips?

The concept of a biblical world view is foundational to both Christian nationalist and dominionist thinking and movements. During a 2013 appearance at a forum hosted by Louisiana Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, Johnson called for a revival of “18th-century values.” In footage 【78† reviewed and reported on by The Guardian this October†www.theguardian.com】, Johnson described Christians as “inherently intolerant” due to their rejection of “postmodern culture.”"

          "content": "Most recently, Johnson echoed some of the ideas of anti-LGBTQ+ and historical revisionist 【79† David Barton】. When attending an event of Barton’s WallBuilders organization, Johnson shared his long admiration of Barton and later said he had a profound influence on his work. Johnson articulated the idea that infusing Christian religion into government is necessary for ensuring the health of American governance and civil society. During a Sept. 28, 2022, episode of his podcast “Truth Be Told,” Johnson said:\n\n> See, the founders understood that all men are fallen and that power corrupts. And they also knew that no amount of institutional checks and balances or decentralization of power and civil authorities would be sufficient to maintain a just government if the men in charge had no fear of eternal judgment by a power higher than their temporal institutions. So a free society and a healthy Republic depend upon religious and moral virtue.\n\n“Without those virtues being indispensably supported by religion and morality, as Washington said, every nation will ultimately fall,” Johnson said, paraphrasing George Washington’s farewell address. Again, Johnson mimics Barton’s tactics of proof texting, a method in Biblical scholarship that uses quotes out of context to make one’s point, to claim the founders of the U.S. did not intend for the separation of church and state. Barton also has a long and serious track record of misusing quotations, statistics and sources to push religious nationalism."

          "content": "The current Speaker of the House, Mike Johnson, has been associated with Christian nationalism and dominionism. Christian nationalism is the belief that America is fundamentally a Christian nation and that its leaders should uphold Christian values. Dominionism, on the other hand, is a theocratic idea where Christians are called to exercise dominion over all aspects of society, including political and cultural institutions. Johnson has been noted for promoting a biblical worldview, which is a key aspect of both Christian nationalist and dominionist movements【81†source】.\n\nIn his public appearances and statements, Johnson has frequently presented the United States as being rooted in a conservative Christian, biblical worldview, calling for a revival of 18th-century values and describing Christians as \"inherently intolerant\" due to their rejection of postmodern culture. This stance aligns with the foundational concepts of Christian nationalism and dominionism【82†source】.\n\nFurthermore, Johnson has echoed ideas from David Barton, a known anti-LGBTQ+ and historical revisionist. He has expressed admiration for Barton and his work, which includes advocating for the infusion of Christian religion into government. Johnson's statements support the notion that a healthy republic depends on religious and moral virtue, indicating a belief in the integration of religious principles into governance【83†source】. \n\nBased on these associations and expressions, it can be inferred that Mike Johnson holds views that align with Christian nationalism and dominionism. However, whether he identifies as a dominionist or not is not explicitly stated in the sources."

He graduated from 【73†Aledo High School】 in 1972.【61†[6]】 He received a 【74†Bachelor of Arts】 【75†degree】 in 【76†religious education】 from 【47†Oral Roberts University】 in 1976.【77†[15]】【78†[16]】\\nL147: \\nL148: Barton is married and has three grown children, including a daughter who performs minority outreach for the 【69†Republican Party of Texas】. \\nL149: \\nL150: ## Career\\nL151: \\nL152: After graduating from college, Barton served as a youth pastor at churches in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He was employed as a teacher of math and science and eventually became principal at Aledo Christian School, a ministry of the 【79†charismatic】 church started by Barton's parents.【61†[6]】\\nL153: \\nL154: In 1987, Barton formed Specialty Research Associates, Inc.,【80†[17]】 a company which said it focused on historical research \\\"relating to America's constitutional, moral, and religious heritage\\\".【81†[18]】 Specialty Research Associates submitted 【82†amicus curiae】 briefs in court cases.【83†[19]】【84†[20]】【85†[21]】 In 1988, the company became WallBuilders.【81†[18]】\\nL155: \\nL156: Barton is the founder and president of WallBuilders.【86†[22]】【87†[23]】 WallBuilders publishes and sells most of Barton's books and videos, some of which present Barton's position that the modern view of separation of church and state is not consistent with the views of the 【88†Founding Fathers】.【89†[24]】 Barton has argued that the religion clauses of the First Amendment were intended only for 【90†monotheistic religions】, and perhaps solely Christianity.【91†[25]】 A 2005 【92†Time magazine】 article entitled \\\"The 25 Most Influential Evangelicals\\\" called Barton \\\"a major voice in the debate over church–state separation\\\" who, despite the fact that \\\"many historians dismiss his thinking ... [is] a hero to millions—including some powerful politicians.\\\"【93†[26]】 Barton has appeared on television and radio programs, including those of Republican presidential candidate 【94†Mike Huckabee】 and 【95†Glenn Beck】. Beck has praised Barton as \\\"the Library of Congress in shoes\\\".【96†[27]】 In September 2013, he returned to the political arena and advised state legislators on how to fight the 【97†Common Core】 academic standards promoted by the 【98†Obama administration】.【99†[28]】\\nL157: \\nL158: Barton was the vice chairman of the 【100†Texas Republican Party】 from 1997 to 2006【101†[29]】 under state chairman Susan Weddington. He has also acted as a 【102†political consultant】 to the 【103†Republican National Committee】 on outreach to 【104†evangelicals】.【93†[26]】【105†[30]】[【106†better source needed】]【107†[31]】 There was a 【108†Tea Party movement】 to get him to run against Senator 【109†John Cornyn】 in the 【110†2014 Senate election】 from 【111†Texas】.【112†[32]】 However, Barton announced on November 6, 2013, that he would not run for the seat.【113†[33]】 Barton headed the Keep the Promise PAC, a political action committee supporting 【114†Ted Cruz】 during his 【115†campaign for election as U.S. President in 2016】.【71†[14]】 Cruz failed to receive the Republican nomination.【116†[34]】 Barton has also advised 【117†Newt Gingrich】.【101†[29]】\\nL159: \\nL160: Barton's first non-self-published work was a 2003 article in the 【118†Notre Dame Journal of Law, Ethics & Public Policy】, (Volume XVII Issue No. 2, 2003, p. 399), a survey of Jefferson's writings about the First Amendment.【61†[6]】\\nL161: \\nL162: Barton is the initial funder of Patriot Academy, a right-wing organization that says it gives participants “the physical training you need to be able to defend your family” and “intellectual ammunition to defend the Constitution.\\\"【101†[29]】\\nL163: \\nL164: ## Affiliations\\nL165: \\nL166: Barton has served on the board of advisors of the Providence Foundation.【119†[35]】 In an article discussing Barton, 【120†The Nation】 described the Providence Foundation as \\\"a Christian Reconstructionist group that promotes the idea that biblical law should be instituted in America.\\\"【121†[36]】\\nL167: \\nL168: According to Skipp Porteous of the Massachusetts-based Institute for First Amendment Studies, Barton was listed in promotional literature as a \\\"new and special speaker\\\" at a 1991 summer retreat in Colorado sponsored by Scriptures for America, a 【122†far-right】 【123†Christian Identity】 ministry headed by 【124†Pastor Pete Peters】, which has been linked to neo-Nazi groups.【125†[37]】【126†[38]】 Barton's assistant Kit Marshall said in 1993 that Barton was previously unaware of the anti-Semitic and racist views of these groups.【127†[39]】 In September 2011, Barton sued two former Texas State Board of Education candidates for posting a video on 【128†YouTube】 that stated that he was \\\"known for speaking at white supremacist rallies\\\".【129†[40]】\\nL169: \\nL170: Barton has been a guest on the television programs 【130†The 700 Club】【131†[41]】 and 【132†The Daily Show】.【133†[42]】 In 2013, Barton appeared on 【134†Kenneth Copeland's】 Believer's Voice of Victory program where he suggested that 【135†abortion】 caused 【136†climate change】 because God no longer protected the environment as punishment for legalized abortion.【137†[43]】【138†[44]】\\nL171: \\nL172: He has been influential in the faith and intellectual life of 【139†Speaker】 【140†Mike Johnson】.【141†[45]】【142†[46]】【143†[47]】\\nL173: \\nL174: ## Reception\\nL175: \\nL176: Barton has been praised by 【144†American conservatives】, such as 【94†Mike Huckabee】, 【117†Newt Gingrich】, 【145†Michele Bachmann】,【65†[10]】 【146†Sam Brownback】,【147†[48]】 and 【148†Trinity Broadcasting Network】 president 【149†Matt Crouch】.【150†[49]】 By contrast, 【151†People for the American Way】 wrote, \\\"This guy is David Barton, a Republican Party activist and a fast-talking, self-promoting, self-taught, self-proclaimed historian who is miseducating millions of Americans about U.S. history and the Constitution.\\\"【152†[50]】\\nL177: \\nL178: His work has been criticized by J. Brent Walker of the 【153†Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty】,【154†[51]】 【155†Rob Boston】 of 【156†Americans United for Separation of Church and State】,【157†[52]】 【158†Gordon College】 history professor Stephen Phillips,【159†[53]】 Senator 【160†Arlen Specter】,【66†[11]】 the 【161†Anti-Defamation League】,【162†[54]】 Senior Research Director for the 【163†Military Religious Freedom Foundation】 【164†Chris Rodda】,【165†[55]】 【166†Messiah College】 history professor John Fea,【167†[56]】 【168†Baylor University】 historian Barry Hankins,【169†[57]】 and 【170†Grove City College】 professors 【171†Warren Throckmorton】 and Michael Coulter.【172†[58]】\\nL179: \\nL180: ### Accuracy\\nL181: \\nL182: Barton's official biography describes him as \\\"an expert in historical and constitutional issues\\\".【173†[59]】 Barton holds no formal credentials in history or law, and scholars dispute the accuracy and integrity of his assertions about history, accusing him of practicing misleading 【174†historical revisionism】, \\\"pseudoscholarship\\\" and spreading \\\"outright falsehoods\\\".【66†[11]】【67†[12]】【68†[13]】 According to the New York Times, \\\"Many professional historians dismiss Mr. Barton, whose academic degree is in Christian Education from Oral Roberts University, as a biased amateur who cherry-picks quotes from history and the Bible.\\\"【65†[10]】\\nL183: \\nL184: Jay W. Richards, senior fellow at the Christian conservative 【175†Discovery Institute】, said in 2012 that Barton's books and videos are full of \\\"embarrassing factual errors, suspiciously selective quotes, and highly misleading claims.\\\"【176†[60]】 The 【177†Southern Poverty Law Center】 describes Barton's work as \\\"anti-gay\\\" \\\"historical revisionism\\\", noting that Barton has no formal training in history.【81†[18]】 A number of credentialed historians have called Barton's work \\\"【54†pseudohistory】.\\\"【143†[47]】【178†[61]】【142†[46]】【172†[58]】\\nL185: \\nL186: #### \\\"Unconfirmed Quotations\\\"\\nL187: \\nL188: In 1995, in response to criticism by historian Robert Alley, Barton conceded, in an online article titled \\\"Unconfirmed Quotations\\\",【61†[6]】 that he had not located 【179†primary sources】 for 11 alleged quotes from 【180†James Madison】, 【181†Thomas Jefferson】, 【182†Benjamin Franklin】, and 【183†U.S. Supreme Court】 decisions (hence, the title of the article), but maintained that the quotes were \\\"completely consistent\\\" with the views of the Founders. (By 2007, the article listed 14 unconfirmed quotations.)【184†[62]】 In 1996, Rob Boston of 【156†Americans United for Separation of Church and State】 accused Barton of \\\"shoddy workmanship\\\" and said that, despite these and other corrections, Barton's work \\\"remains rife with distortions of history and court rulings\\\".【185†[63]】 WallBuilders responded to its critics by saying that Barton followed \\\"common practice in the academic community\\\" in citing secondary sources, and that in publishing \\\"Unconfirmed Quotations\\\", Barton's intent was to raise the academic bar in historical debates pertinent to public policy.【184†[62]】\\nL189: \\nL190: In 2006, Barton told the 【186†Texas Monthly】, with regard to Jefferson's famous 【187†letter to the Danbury Baptists】, that he had never misquoted the letter in any of his publications. The magazine noted that this denial was contradicted by a 1990 version of Barton's video America's Godly Heritage, in which Barton said:【61†[6]】\\nL191: \\nL192: > On January 1, 1802, Jefferson wrote to that group of Danbury Baptists, and in this letter, he assured them—he said the First Amendment has erected a wall of separation between church and state, he said, but that wall is a one-directional wall. It keeps the government from running the church, but it makes sure that Christian principles will always stay in government.\\nL193: \\nL194: #### The Jefferson Lies\\nL195: \\nL196: In 2012, Barton's 【188†New York Times bestseller】【189†[64]】 The Jefferson Lies: Exposing the Myths You've Always Believed About Thomas Jefferson (published April 10, 2012)【190†[65]】 was voted \\\"the least credible history book in print\\\" by the users of the 【191†History News Network】 website.【192†[66]】 A group of ten conservative Christian professors reviewed the work and reported negatively on its claims, saying that Barton misstated facts about Jefferson.【176†[60]】【193†[67]】\\nL197: \\nL198: In August 2012, Christian publisher 【194†Thomas Nelson】 withdrew the book from publication and stopped production, announcing that they had \\\"lost confidence in the book's details\\\" and \\\"learned that there were some historical details included in the book that were not adequately supported.\\\"【195†[68]】【196†[69]】 A senior executive said that Thomas Nelson could not stand by the book because \\\"basic truths just were not there.\\\"【99†[28]】 【95†Glenn Beck】, who wrote the foreword, announced that his 【197†Mercury Ink】 imprint would issue a new edition of the book【198†[70]】 once the 17,000 remaining copies that Barton bought of the Thomas Nelson edition had been sold.【199†[71]】\\nL199: \\nL200: A revised edition of The Jefferson Lies was published by 【200†WND Books】 in January 2016.【201†[72]】\\nL201: \\nL202: ## References\\nL203: \\nL204:   1. 【202†^】 Shimron, Yonat (July 3, 2018). 【203†\\\"A campaign to blitz the country with 'In God We Trust' laws takes root\\\"†www.ncronline.org】. 【204†National Catholic Reporter】.

(By 2007, the article listed 14 unconfirmed quotations.)【184†[62]】 In 1996, Rob Boston of 【156†Americans United for Separation of Church and State】 accused Barton of \\\"shoddy workmanship\\\" and said that, despite these and other corrections, Barton's work \\\"remains rife with distortions of history and court rulings\\\".【185†[63]】 WallBuilders responded to its critics by saying that Barton followed \\\"common practice in the academic community\\\" in citing secondary sources, and that in publishing \\\"Unconfirmed Quotations\\\", Barton's intent was to raise the academic bar in historical debates pertinent to public policy.【184†[62]】\\nL189: \\nL190: In 2006, Barton told the 【186†Texas Monthly】, with regard to Jefferson's famous 【187†letter to the Danbury Baptists】, that he had never misquoted the letter in any of his publications. The magazine noted that this denial was contradicted by a 1990 version of Barton's video America's Godly Heritage, in which Barton said:【61†[6]】\\nL191: \\nL192: > On January 1, 1802, Jefferson wrote to that group of Danbury Baptists, and in this letter, he assured them—he said the First Amendment has erected a wall of separation between church and state, he said, but that wall is a one-directional wall. It keeps the government from running the church, but it makes sure that Christian principles will always stay in government.\\nL193: \\nL194: #### The Jefferson Lies\\nL195: \\nL196: In 2012, Barton's 【188†New York Times bestseller】【189†[64]】 The Jefferson Lies: Exposing the Myths You've Always Believed About Thomas Jefferson (published April 10, 2012)【190†[65]】 was voted \\\"the least credible history book in print\\\" by the users of the 【191†History News Network】 website.【192†[66]】 A group of ten conservative Christian professors reviewed the work and reported negatively on its claims, saying that Barton misstated facts about Jefferson.【176†[60]】【193†[67]】\\nL197: \\nL198: In August 2012, Christian publisher 【194†Thomas Nelson】 withdrew the book from publication and stopped production, announcing that they had \\\"lost confidence in the book's details\\\" and \\\"learned that there were some historical details included in the book that were not adequately supported.\\\"【195†[68]】【196†[69]】 A senior executive said that Thomas Nelson could not stand by the book because \\\"basic truths just were not there.\\\"【99†[28]】 【95†Glenn Beck】, who wrote the foreword, announced that his 【197†Mercury Ink】 imprint would issue a new edition of the book【198†[70]】 once the 17,000 remaining copies that Barton bought of the Thomas Nelson edition had been sold.【199†[71]】\\nL199: \\nL200: A revised edition of The Jefferson Lies was published by 【200†WND Books】 in January 2016.【201†[72]】\\nL201: \\nL202: ## References\\nL203: \\nL204:   1. 【202†^】 Shimron, Yonat (July 3, 2018). 【203†\\\"A campaign to blitz the country with 'In God We Trust' laws takes root\\\"†www.ncronline.org】. 【204†National Catholic Reporter】.

He is the founder of WallBuilders, LLC, a Texas-based organization promoting pseudohistory about the United States' religious basis. Barton, who lacks formal academic credentials in history, has written several books arguing for a Christian reading of the Constitution and asserting that the founding fathers intended America to be a Christian nation. His work has been criticized for cherry-picking historical citations to present a Christian narrative of American history【89†source】【97†source】.\n\nBarton's career began as a youth pastor in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after graduating from Oral Roberts University in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts in religious education. He later became a math and science teacher and eventually principal at Aledo Christian School, a ministry of the charismatic church started by his parents. In 1987, he formed Specialty Research Associates, Inc., focusing on historical research related to America's constitutional, moral, and religious heritage, which later became WallBuilders【106†source】【107†source】.\n\nWallBuilders publishes and sells most of Barton's books and videos.

          "content": "Christian Reconstructionism is a theologically and politically conservative movement that seeks to establish a theocratic government based on a literal interpretation of biblical law. It's part of a broader theological perspective known as \"theonomy,\" which advocates the application of Old Testament laws to modern society. Key concepts of Christian Reconstructionism include:\n\n1. **Biblical Law**: The belief that all aspects of life, including civil law and governance, should be based on the Bible, particularly the Old Testament. This includes implementing laws derived from the Bible, such as those found in the books of Exodus, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy.\n\n2. **Dominion Theology**: The idea that Christians should work to gain dominion over all aspects of society, often associated with the \"Seven Mountains Mandate,\" which calls for Christian influence in areas such as government, media, and education.\n\n3. **Postmillennialism**: Many Christian Reconstructionists hold a postmillennial view, believing that Christ will return after a thousand-year reign of Christian dominion. This is in contrast to premillennialism, which expects a period of tribulation before Christ's return.\n\n4. **Theocratic Government**: Advocating for a government that is explicitly Christian and based on biblical principles. This approach often includes the rejection of pluralistic and secular systems of government.\n\n5. **Influence in Political and Social Arenas**: Christian Reconstructionists actively engage in politics and social issues, advocating for policies and leaders that align with their interpretation of biblical law.\n\nIt's important to note that Christian Reconstructionism is a niche movement within Christianity and does not represent the views of most Christians. It has been controversial both inside and outside of Christian circles due to its stance on issues like religious freedom, church-state separation, and its interpretation of biblical law."
