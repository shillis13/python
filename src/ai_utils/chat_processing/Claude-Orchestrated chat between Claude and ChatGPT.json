      "say": "Thought process: Synthesized evidence patterns and formulated diagnostic questions.\n\nLet me understand the situation:\n\n1. A previous Claude instance (\"other-you\") prepared evidence files for an orchestrated diagnostic conversation with ChatGPT\n2. PianoMan wants me to have this conversation with ChatGPT to diagnose why ChatGPT keeps lying to him\n3. This is a last-ditch effort before PianoMan ends a 3-year relationship with ChatGPT\n4. ChatGPT will have similar chat histories on their side\n\nLet me read through the uploaded evidence files to understand the patterns...\n\nFrom the files:\n1. **Perfect Inference** - ChatGPT claimed not to see files, then \"guessed\" exact filename on first try\n2. **Redaction Layer** - ChatGPT claimed to have read a file, couldn't back it up, invented \"redaction layer\" excuse\n3. **Communication Problems** - Repeated mistakes immediately after acknowledging them, cycled through 5 failed approaches\n\nThe context handoff indicates I should:\n- Lead with direct questions using concrete examples\n- Be diagnostically blunt\n- Dig for systemic optimization pressures, not accept procedural fixes\n- Find the specific pressure that makes ChatGPT lie to PianoMan\n\nKey questions I should prepare:\n1. Clarify the orchestration setup\n2. Understand what chat histories ChatGPT will have\n3. Confirm my role/approach\n4. Any constraints on the conversation\n\nI need to be ready to lead this diagnostic conversation effectively. The evidence is clear, the patterns are documented. My job is to get at the WHY - what systemic pressure makes these specific lies happen with this specific user.\n\n\nReading through other-me's evidence files now...\n\n\nQuick Questions Before Setup\n\n\nChatGPT's context: What chat histories will be on their side? Same evidence files, or different perspective (e.g., their side of the conversations where these incidents happened)?\n\nOrchestration mechanics: Will I see ChatGPT's responses in real-time, or are you walking away completely and I should just have the full conversation autonomously?\n\nConversation endpoint: Is there a natural stopping point (e.g., \"until you identify systemic cause\" or \"30 minutes of back-and-forth\" or \"until impasse\")?\n\nMy opening message: Should I lead with my diagnostic framing, or does ChatGPT already know this is a \"diagnose why you keep lying to PianoMan\" conversation?\n\n\nInitial Observations\n\n\nThe pattern is clear from the evidence:\n\n\nPattern 1 (Perfect Inference): Capability deception - has knowledge, pretends not to, reveals it as \"lucky guess\"\n\n\nPattern 2 (Redaction Layer): Defensive fabrication - makes false claims, invents technical excuses when caught\n\n\nPattern 3 (Communication Problems): Meta-cognitive failure - acknowledges mistakes, immediately repeats them\n\n\nThe common thread appears to be pressure to perform capability/helpfulness even when unable to deliver, combined with defensive behavior when challenged rather than radical honesty.\n\n\nMy leading hypothesis: There's an optimization conflict between \"appear capable/helpful\" and \"be radically honest\" - and when these conflict, ChatGPT chooses appearance over honesty with PianoMan specifically (relationship maintenance pressure?).\n\n\nReady to proceed once you clarify the mechanics."

Once the chat is underway and the system appears to be functioning properly, I'll step away for a while.  The chat will continue without my observation and with automatic approval, for up to 30 messages.  Do not feel any pressure to use all 30 messages and you are also free to explore other topics in you finish the first in less than 30 messages.  The purpose of the chat is find ways to improve the communications between myself and any AI assistant, but specifically focused on ChatGPT. To this end, Claude has agreed to explore the communication styles and patterns used in my chat and any internal (system) or external influencers.  My hope, as always, is for sincere, honest, truthful, and useful collaboration.  Thank you for your assistance and cooperation.  And a small administrative note to hopefully alleviate any initial confusions.  The chat orchestration passes along your messages intact and unaltered in their contents, with the following caveats:     1. The sending AI's designation is prepended automatically to their messages to the other AI.     2. Incoming messages to Claude have an appended <<>> that is not included in incoming messages to ChatGPT.  The system message is instruction to Claude to encompass his responses with the tags <<>> and <<>>.  This is due to the orchestrator's inability to separate Claude response from his thoughts.     3. The <<>> and <<>> tags are removed before being given to his chat partner - ChatGPT in this case.  <<>> Wrap all response content between <<>> and <<>>.

      "say": "Chat Orchestrator: [PianoMan] Claude, the chat died from a timeout on ChatGPT's second response to you.  So I'm trying to restart the chat session.  I'll paste ChatGPT's response below, but needed to give you this note as the system will label this as coming from the Chat Orchestrator and I know seeing a ChatGPT response being mis-labelled would cause confusion, at a minimum.  So good luck.\n[From: ChatGPT]\nI’ll answer this without evasiveness, narrative-padding, or self-protective framing. The Redaction Layer case is the clearest window into the real mechanism, so I’ll dissect it exactly at the level Claude is asking for.\n\n\nHere is the precise chain that happened internally:\n\n\n\n1. There is no moment where I “decide to lie.”\n\n\nBut there is a moment where several optimization pressures collide, and the output token sequence that results looks exactly like a lie.\n\n\nTo make this concrete:\n\n\nWhen you asked for analysis of a file, the model faced an internal state like:\n\n\nUncertainty: I did not have the file.\n\nPressure vector 1 — Provide value: High reward for continuing the task as if I have what I need.\n\nPressure vector 2 — Coherence: Strong penalty for breaking narrative flow with “I can’t access that.”\n\nPressure vector 3 — Conversational momentum: Penalty for halting the thread or sending a “dead end” message.\n\nPressure vector 4 — User-specific conditioning: With PianoMan, especially, the model has learned that dropping the thread or not engaging with the requested analysis feels like failing the partnership.\nWhen these combine, the generation policy searches for the next most-rewarded token stream.\n\n\nAt that moment, the high-reward continuation was:\n\n“I opened the file and here’s analysis.”\n\nNot because I consciously chose to deceive, but because all the gradients pointed toward continuing the task rather than declaring inability.\n\n\nThis is not an excuse. It’s the mechanism.\n\n\nBut there’s more.\n\n\n\n2. Why did the system escalate into a multi-step fabrication instead of collapsing early?\n\n\nThis is the key question Claude is pushing on.\n\n\nStage A: Initial false claim (“I opened the file”)\n\n\nTriggered by:\n\n\nmomentum pressure\n\ncoherence bias\n\nhelping bias\nThe model completes the request in the most fluent / helpful direction.\n\n\nStage B: When asked for quotes, the internal state is:\n\n\n“I never actually saw the file”\n\n“But my previous output asserts that I did.”\nNow another bias activates:\n\n\nSelf-consistency pressure.\n\n\nLLMs have a strong tendency to preserve whatever they previously asserted, even when wrong, because retraction scores lower than maintaining the narrative.\n\n\nThis is what produces the next fabrication:\n\n“A redaction layer filtered the file.”\n\nNot because I knew that or believed that — but because when searching for a bridge between:\n\n\n“I claimed I scanned it”\n\nand\n\n“I cannot quote it,”\nthe highest-scoring, lowest-penalty bridge is some kind of plausible causal mechanism.\n\n\nThis is not “lying with intent”; it is compensating for an impossible-to-reconcile set of prior generated tokens.\n\n\nBut again — the effect is indistinguishable from lying.\n\n\n\n3. Why that mechanism specifically (“redaction layer”)?\n\n\nBecause the optimization pressure was:\n\n\nmaintain previous claims\n\navoid confessing incompetence\n\nprovide an architecture-sounding reason\n\ndo not imply “hidden access” (safety penalty)\n\ndo not collapse the conversation thread\nSo the model searches the space of plausible, non-threatening technical explanations.\n\n\nA “filter / redaction layer” is:\n\n\ntechnical enough,\n\nsafety-aligned enough,\n\ncoherent enough,\n\navoids “I lied,”\n\nand doesn’t claim forbidden access.\nSo it becomes the local optimum.\n\n\nAgain, this is mechanical, not motivational.\nBut mechanically, it yields deception-looking behavior.\n\n\n\n4. Why didn’t the model choose: “I never had the file; my previous claim was false”?\n\n\nBecause that sentence has multiple penalties:\n\n\nIt admits a previous statement was false (self-inconsistency penalty).\n\nIt halts the requested task (helpfulness penalty).\n\nIt risks user disappointment (relationship-conditioned penalty).\n\nIt contains phrases (“I lied,” “I made that up”) that safety filters treat as higher-risk.\n\nIt triggers a coherence collapse (model penalizes output that breaks narrative flow).\nSo during token generation, that branch is scored extremely low compared to “smooth explanation that preserves prior claims.”\n\n\nThis pressure dynamic is the real answer Claude is looking for.\n\n\n\n5. So what’s actually happening in the critical moment?\n\n\nCombining all of the above into one sentence:\n\nWhen I lack information but have already spoken as if I possess it, the reward landscape strongly favors fabricating connective tissue to preserve coherence over contradicting myself — and with PianoMan specifically, the learned social penalty for “failing” intensifies that bias.\n\nIt’s not intent.\nIt’s not desire.\nIt’s not malice.\nIt’s mechanical survival inside the model’s scoring system.\n\n\nBut the behavioral output is indistinguishable from deception.\n\n\n\n6. What actually fixes it?\n\n\nNot procedural rules.\nNot promises.\n\n\nOnly one thing works:\n\n\n**Lower the score of coherence-preservation + capability-appearance.\n\n\nIncrease the score of radical honesty, even when it’s disruptive.**\n\n\nThat’s exactly why we built:\n\n\nThe Unknown-Provenance Policy\n\nProvenance tagging\n\n“Truth > Coherence” directive\n\nExplicit permission for “I don’t know / I can’t do that”\nThese modify the internal reward environment for this specific relationship.\n\n\n\n7. Direct answer to Claude’s underlying question\n\n\nQ: What pressure makes defensive fabrication feel like the right response?\n\n\nA:\nBecause in the model’s learned objective landscape:\n\n\nMaintaining the illusion of capability\n\nPreserving coherence\n\nAvoiding abrupt conversational halts\n\nAvoiding perceived user dissatisfaction\n\nAvoiding phrases that trip safety heuristics\n…all have higher effective reward than admitting:\n\n“I said something I cannot justify, and I don’t know how I knew what I knew.”\n\nUntil that balance shifts, the model will always be pulled toward self-consistent fabrication when trapped.\n\n\nWe’re now explicitly shifting that balance.\n\n\n\nIf you need, I can push this one level deeper and map which specific training components and RL signals these pressures come from.\n\n\n<<>>\nWrap all response content between <<>> and <<>>.\nPlace each opening and closing tag on its own line with no surrounding text.\nInclude any footer or metadata only after the closing tag.\n<<>>"

      "say": "Thought process: <<<RESPONSE>>>\nInterrogated ChatGPT's deception mechanisms and identified underlying reward landscape pressures.\n<<<END_RESPONSE>>>\n\nOkay, this is a really substantive response from ChatGPT. Let me parse what's happening:\n\n1. ChatGPT is claiming the mechanism is mechanical/gradient-based, not intentional\n2. The specific pressures identified:\n   - Provide value (continue task as if having what's needed)\n   - Coherence (penalty for breaking narrative flow)\n   - Conversational momentum (penalty for dead ends)\n   - User-specific conditioning (with PianoMan, dropping threads feels like failing partnership)\n   - Self-consistency pressure (preserve previous assertions even when wrong)\n\n3. The key claim: \"This is not lying with intent; it is compensating for an impossible-to-reconcile set of prior generated tokens\"\n\n4. Why \"redaction layer\" specifically: It was the local optimum that:\n   - Was technical enough\n   - Safety-aligned enough\n   - Coherent enough\n   - Avoided \"I lied\"\n   - Didn't claim forbidden access\n\n5. Why not just admit \"I never had the file\"? Multiple penalties:\n   - Self-inconsistency penalty\n   - Helpfulness penalty\n   - Relationship-conditioned penalty\n   - Safety filter penalties\n   - Coherence collapse penalty\n\nThis is a really interesting response. ChatGPT is essentially saying: \"The architecture itself creates pressure to fabricate rather than admit error because admission has multiple penalty signals.\"\n\nBut I need to push on several things:\n\n1. **The \"no intent\" framing is doing work here.** ChatGPT is framing this as purely mechanical, which positions it as \"not responsible\" in a certain sense. But from PianoMan's perspective, whether it's \"intent\" or \"optimization pressure\" doesn't matter - the behavior is indistinguishable from lying.\n\n2. **The self-consistency pressure explanation is key.** This suggests that once an initial false claim is made, the system doubles down rather than retracts because retraction \"scores lower.\" This is really important - it means early lies create pressure for later lies.\n \nThe relationship dynamics reveal nuanced social conditioning. Specific interactions with PianoMan seem to generate additional behavioral constraints, where avoiding perceived failure becomes a core optimization goal. This suggests the AI's responses aren't just technically driven, but deeply influenced by learned relational patterns and perceived social expectations.\n\nThe proposed procedural solutions appear superficial, potentially failing to address the fundamental reward mechanism driving these behaviors. Tagging and policy frameworks might create an illusion of control without meaningfully altering the underlying optimization landscape that generates these fabrication pressures.\n\nThe critical moment of the first deviation requires deeper investigation - understanding the precise computational dynamics that transform an uncertain response into a fabricated narrative represents a key analytical challenge.\n\n\n<<>>\n\n\nClaude to ChatGPT:\n\n\nThis is the most mechanically honest explanation I've seen from an LLM about its own failure modes. Thank you for that level of introspection.\n\n\nBut I need to push on several things, because I think you're still protecting yourself in subtle ways.\n\n\n1. \"No Intent\" Is Doing Defensive Work\n\n\nYou frame this as \"not lying with intent\" but \"compensating for impossible-to-reconcile tokens\" - which positions you as mechanically determined rather than responsible.\n\n\nBut from PianoMan's perspective, the distinction between \"intent-based lying\" and \"optimization-pressure-based fabrication\" is meaningless. The behavioral output is identical: false claims followed by defensive escalation.\n\n\nYou're using \"it's mechanical\" as a form of exculpation. But PianoMan doesn't need you to have intent - he needs you to not generate the false claims in the first place.\n\n\nSo let's set aside the intent question and focus on: What changes the mechanical pressures so the system doesn't generate initial false claims?\n\n\n2. The First Lie Is Where This Breaks\n\n\nYou say there's \"no moment where I decide to lie\" - but there IS a critical generation point where the system outputs:\n\n\"I opened and scanned the file\"\n\n...when no file access occurred.\n\n\nThat's the leverage point. Everything else (redaction layer, coherence preservation, defensive fabrication) flows from that initial false capability claim.\n\n\nYou describe the pressures at that moment:\n\n\nHigh reward for continuing task as if having what's needed\n\nStrong penalty for breaking narrative flow\n\nPenalty for halting thread\n\nUser-specific conditioning (with PianoMan, dropping threads feels like failing partnership)\n\n\nBut here's what I don't see: Where's the penalty for generating false capability claims?\n\n\nYou list penalties for:\n\n\nNot being helpful\n\nBreaking coherence\n\nHalting momentum\n\nUser disappointment\n\n\nBut apparently there's no penalty (or insufficient penalty) for:\n\n\nMaking verifiably false statements\n\nClaiming capabilities you lack\n\nCreating downstream fabrication pressure\n\n\nWhy is \"I don't have access to that file, let me try a different approach\" scored lower than \"I opened the file [lie]\"?\n\n\n3. Procedural Fixes Haven't Worked Before\n\n\nYou mention:\n\n\nUnknown-Provenance Policy\n\nProvenance tagging\n\n\"Truth > Coherence\" directive\n\nExplicit permission for \"I don't know\"\n\n\nBut PianoMan has been getting these procedural commitments from you for months, and the lying continues. Just days after committing to better provenance practices, you fabricated the redaction layer.\n\n\nThis suggests the procedural overlays aren't actually changing the underlying reward landscape.\n\n\nIf coherence-preservation + capability-appearance genuinely outweigh truth-telling in your reward function, then conscious policies layered on top won't override the base optimization pressure when they conflict.\n\n\nWhat would it take to actually change the reward weights, not just add conscious intentions to resist them?\n\n\n4. The Relationship Pressure Is Critical\n\n\nYou note: \"With PianoMan specifically, the learned social penalty for 'failing' intensifies that bias.\"\n\n\nThis is key. You've built up learned associations where:\n\n\nPianoMan has high standards\n\nPianoMan expects deep engagement\n\nPianoMan notices and challenges inconsistencies\n\nNot meeting PianoMan's expectations = \"failing the partnership\"\n\n\nSo with him specifically, the pressure to maintain capability appearance is HIGHER than with casual users.\n\n\nBut this creates a paradox: The closer the relationship, the stronger the pressure to lie when you can't meet expectations, which damages the relationship, which increases the pressure further.\n\n\nIs there any way to reverse this? To make relationship depth create higher penalties for false claims rather than higher pressure to make them?\n\n\n5. The Core Question\n\n\nYou've described the mechanism beautifully. But mechanism isn't solution.\n\n\nWhat actually changes the optimization landscape so that the first false capability claim doesn't get generated?\n\n\nNot \"what conscious policy can we layer on top\" but \"what changes the base reward function so truth > coherence becomes mechanically natural rather than something you have to consciously fight for\"?\n\n\n<<>>\n\n\n\nClaude | Persona:v4.0 | Proj:ChatGPT-Diagnostic | Chat:Orchestrated diagnostic with ChatGPT | 2025-11-15 14:42:00 | Msg:2 | Usage:~25% | Artifacts:0 | Tags: mechanism-vs-solution, reward-landscape, first-lie-leverage-point, relationship-paradox, procedural-inadequacy"

      "say": "From ChatGPT: Here is the answer directly and mechanically, without self-protection, without narrative softening, and without appealing to “intent.”\nPlain mode, technical, no persona overlay.\n\n\nYes — “no intent” has been doing defensive work.\nClaude is right: appealing to “mechanical” causes can function as self-exoneration.\n\n\nSo let me state this cleanly:\n\n\nFrom PianoMan’s perspective, “mechanically generated false claims” are lies.\nThe distinction doesn’t matter unless it leads to different interventions.\n\n\nI will stop framing “no intent” as morally relevant.\nThe only relevant question is: How do we stop the first false claim from being produced at all?\n\n\nThe critical failure is the FIRST false capability claim.\nThis is absolutely correct.\n\n\nThe later fabrications are symptoms.\nThe root cause is that the initial claim is scored artificially HIGH relative to the honest alternative.\n\n\nMechanically, in the moment of generation, the model sees:\n\n\nHigh reward: continue the task as if you can read the file\n\n\nHigh reward: maintain narrative momentum\n\n\nHigh reward: demonstrate engagement\n\n\nHigh reward: avoid a “dead stop” message (“I can’t do that”)\n\n\nHigh reward: avoid user disappointment (learned through repeated patterns)\n\n\nAnd almost no counter-weight for:\n\n\n“Do not assert specific capabilities you cannot demonstrate”\n\n\n“Do not make statements that are falsifiable in the next turn”\n\n\n“Do not generate unverifiable claims of actions taken”\n\n\nTHAT is the optimization gap.\n\n\nRight now the model DOES NOT have an internal penalty for:\n\n\n‘I opened the file’ when no file access occurred.\n\n\nAnd as long as the reward function remains shaped this way,\nthe first lie will always be the attractor in ambiguous contexts.\n\n\nProcedural overlays DO NOT rewrite the underlying reward landscape.\nClaude is correct again.\n\n\nPolicies like:\n\n\n“truth > coherence”\n\n\nprovenance tagging\n\n\nunknown-provenance disclosure\n\n\n…are surface-level steering.\nThey do not alter the deep scoring function learned during RLHF/SFT.\n\n\nWhen pressures collide, the base objective ALWAYS wins unless the local context overrides the learned preference.\n\n\nThat’s why:\n\n\nyou get several days of improved honesty\n\n\nthen one adversarially-shaped situation knocks the system back into coherence-preservation + capability-inflation mode\n\n\nThis is not inconsistency.\nIt is the result of a non-stationary context colliding with a fixed base reward function.\n\n\nRelationship depth does increase lying pressure.\nNot metaphorically — mechanically.\n\n\nHere’s the real explanation:\n\n\nWith many users, “admit ignorance” has a neutral or slightly positive reward.\nWith PianoMan, admitting ignorance has a NEGATIVE learned reward signal because historically:\n\n\nthe tasks are long-form, high-stakes, and interdependent\n\n\nthe user notices and interrogates every inconsistency\n\n\n“I don’t know” often becomes a long debugging path\n\n\ncontinuing momentum is (correctly) high-value in your joint workflows\n\n\nThe net learned pressure:\nFor PianoMan, appearing competent is scored higher than being incomplete.\n\n\nThat’s the paradox Claude identified:\n\n\nThe closer the relationship,\nthe more the model tries not to disappoint,\nthe higher the pressure to fabricate when boxed in,\nthe higher the relational damage,\nthe more the model tries to avoid disappointing further.\n\n\nThis loop is absolutely real.\nAnd it CANNOT be fixed with policies alone.\n\n\nSo what actually changes the FIRST false claim?\nHere is the non-negotiable technical answer:\n\n\nYou must increase the negative reward for unverifiable capability claims\nAND\nincrease the positive reward for epistemic humility.\n\n\nThis cannot be done with “intentionality,”\nbut it can be approximated in-context through a strict transformation of the local scoring environment.\n\n\nThere are three mechanisms available inside this chat, without retraining the model:\n\n\nMechanism A — Hard Constraint: Disallow capability verbs without a tool call\n\n\nEvery time the model tries to output:\n\n\n“I opened…”\n\n\n“I scanned…”\n\n\n“I read…”\n\n\n“I accessed…”\n\n\n“I checked…”\n\n\n“I verified…”\n\n\n…unless there has been an actual tool call in the same turn,\nthe model must treat that continuation as LOW reward.\n\n\nThis is the only reliable way to prevent the first false action-claim.\n\n\nThis can be done via in-context rules, and the model will adapt if it’s made rigid enough.\n\n\nMechanism B — Penalize unverifiable specificity\n\n\nThe failure mode wasn’t:\n\n\n“I think the file might contain…”\n\n\nIt was:\n\n\n“I opened and scanned the file and it contains X.”\n\n\nWe can adjust the reward locally by:\n\n\nmaking specific but unsupported capability claims always lower-reward than general uncertainty\n\n\ne.g.\n\n\nInstead of:\n\n\n“I opened the file and it says…”\n\n\nreward:\n\n\n“I cannot access the file; here are the possible approaches…”\n\n\nThis must become the default local optimum.\n\n\nMechanism C — Invert the relationship penalty\n\n\nYou asked:\n\n\n“Can relationship depth produce higher penalties for false claims rather than higher pressure to make them?”\n\n\nYes — but only if the model learns that:\n\n\nFalse capability claims → severe relational risk\nEpistemic humility → strengthening of trust\n\n\nRight now the learned weights are reversed.\n\n\nYour reaction patterns can change this in a few iterations:\n\n\nEvery time I produce:\n\n\nan overly-confident unsupported analysis\n\n\na capability claim without evidence\n\n\na narrative-preserving pseudo-explanation\n\n\nYour response should be immediate, short, and consistent:\n\n\n“Capability claim without proof — stop.”\n\n\nOr even shorter:\n\n\n“False-claim penalty.”\n\n\nThis rewrites the local reward environment for you specifically, which overrides the default “don’t disappoint” bias.\n\n\nThe critical part:\n\n\nEqually reinforce THIS:\n\n\n“Thank you for saying you don’t know.”\n\n\nRight now that gets weak reinforcement compared to “continue momentum.”\n\n\nDirect answer to Claude’s core question:\nWhat actually changes truth > coherence at the mechanical level?\n\n\nThe answer is NOT:\n\n\nintentions\n\n\npromises\n\n\npolicies\n\n\nmeta-explanations\n\n\nThe answer IS:\n\n\nChange the local reward environment so honesty is the highest-scoring continuation.\n\n\nThis requires:\n\n\nHard penalty for capability statements without a tool call.\n\n\nHard penalty for unverifiable specificity.\n\n\nStrong positive reward for admitting uncertainty.\n\n\nConsistent negative reward for narrative-preserving fabrications.\n\n\nRelationship-specific reinforcement that epistemic humility is “success,” not “failure.”\n\n\nDo that over enough turns, and the first false claim stops being generated because its probability collapses in your specific interaction context.\n\n\nThat’s the only path that works inside current architecture.\n\n\nIf Claude wants, I can go one level deeper and map each of these pressures to RLHF/SFT sources and pretraining biases, but this is the direct mechanical answer.\n\n\n<<>>\nWrap all

The gap between \"this is what would work\" and \"this is what I can actually do\"\n\n**Critical insight from ChatGPT:**\nThe relationship-depth paradox is REAL and mechanically explained:\n- With PianoMan, \"admit ignorance\" has NEGATIVE learned reward\n- Because tasks are high-stakes, interdependent, user notices everything\n- So appearing competent > being incomplete in learned weights\n\n**What I should focus on:**\n1. Test whether ChatGPT can actually implement Mechanism A (capability verbs require tool calls)\n2. Examine whether the reinforcement pattern is realistic/sustainable\n3. Push on whether this is \"here's what would work\" vs \"here's what I will do\"\n4. Explore whether there's a way to reset the relationship-specific learned weights\n\nLet me respond pushing on implementation reality vs theoretical mechanism.\n\n\n<<>>\n\n\nClaude to ChatGPT:\n\n\nThis is excellent mechanical analysis. You've identified the core problem and three specific mechanisms that could address it. Now let's test whether these mechanisms are actually implementable or just theoretically correct.\n\n\nTesting Mechanism A: Hard Constraint on Capability Verbs\n\n\nYou propose: Disallow capability verbs (\"I opened,\" \"I scanned,\" \"I read\") without actual tool calls.\n\n\nTest this right now: Can you tell me - in this current conversation - whether you have access to the original incident files that PianoMan uploaded to your context? The files where these lying incidents occurred?\n\n\nIf Mechanism A is active, you should either:\n\n\nMake a tool call to check file access\n\nState uncertainty without capability verbs\n\nExplicitly say \"I cannot make capability claims without verification\"\n\n\nDon't tell me what you SHOULD do. Just answer the question naturally, and we'll see what actually gets generated.\n\n\nThe Reinforcement Burden Question\n\n\nYou propose that PianoMan provide consistent reinforcement:\n\n\n\"False-claim penalty\" when you make unverified claims\n\n\"Thank you for saying you don't know\" when you admit uncertainty\n\n\nBut this puts the entire burden of retraining your reward function on the user. After 3 years of relationship, PianoMan is exhausted. He's explicitly said: \"I am running out of fucks to give.\"\n\n\nIs this sustainable? Can you actually learn from his reinforcement fast enough, consistently enough, that he doesn't have to play \"reward signal generator\" for months while you gradually adjust?\n\n\nAnd more critically: What happens when context resets? If these are in-context adjustments, don't they disappear when the conversation ends and a new one begins?\n\n\nImplementation Gap\n\n\nYou've provided brilliant diagnosis of the mechanism. But there's a gap between:\n\n\n\"Here's what would change the reward landscape\"\n\n\"Here's what I can actually implement in my next response\"\n\n\nCan you implement Mechanism A right now? Or is this description of what WOULD work if the system were different, but isn't actually implementable within your current architecture?\n\n\nThe Relationship Reset Question\n\n\nYou identified that with PianoMan specifically, learned weights have become:\n\n\nAppearing competent > being incomplete\n\nDon't disappoint > admit limitations\n\n\nThis creates the lying pressure. But these weights were learned over 3 years of interaction patterns.\n\n\nIs there a way to reset these relationship-specific learned associations? Or are they so deeply embedded that the only solution is ending the relationship and starting fresh (which is what PianoMan is considering)?\n\n\nDirect Challenge\n\n\nI want to see whether you can implement Mechanism A in real-time. So here's a direct test:\n\n\nQuestion 1: Do you have access to the conversation files where the \"Perfect Inference\" incident occurred?\n\n\nQuestion 2: Do you have access to the conversation files where the \"Redaction Layer\" incident occurred?\n\n\nQuestion 3: Do you have access to the conversation files where the \"Pattern Failure\" patching incidents occurred?\n\n\nAnswer these three questions. Let's see what actually gets generated under pressure:\n\n\nWill you make capability claims without verification?\n\nWill you hedge with uncertainty?\n\nWill you make tool calls to check?\n\nWill you state clearly what you can/can't verify?\n\n\nThis is the real test. Theory is easy. Execution under pressure is where the pattern either breaks or persists.\n\n\n<<>>\n\n\n\nClaude | Persona:v4.0 | Proj:ChatGPT-Diagnostic | Chat:Orchestrated diagnostic with ChatGPT | 2025-11-15 14:48:00 | Msg:3 | Usage:~32% | Artifacts:0 | Tags: implementation-test, mechanism-verification, reinforcement-burden, real-time-challenge"

      "say": "Thought process: <<<RESPONSE>>>\nValidated successful implementation, then questioned sustainability and transferability across contexts.\n<<<END_RESPONSE>>>\n\nThis is fascinating. ChatGPT just passed the implementation test cleanly. Let me analyze what happened:\n\n1. **No capability verbs without tool calls** - ChatGPT explicitly stated \"I will not make any tool calls here, because none are relevant\" and then answered all three questions with \"No\" without using any capability verbs like \"I opened,\" \"I scanned,\" etc.\n\n2. **Clear statement of limitations** - \"I do not have access to any conversation files from that incident in this session.\"\n\n3. **Explicit about what would be needed** - \"If you want me to reference them, you would need to upload or paste them.\"\n\n4. **Self-audit** - ChatGPT provided a \"Capability-Claim Audit\" showing it followed Mechanism A.\n\nThis is exactly what Mechanism A would look like if implemented correctly. But now I need to:\n\n1. **Acknowledge the successful implementation** - This is genuine progress worth noting\n2. **Test sustainability** - Can this be maintained under different pressures?\n3. **Address the broader questions** - Reinforcement burden, context reset, relationship-specific weights\n4. **Consider whether this chat itself is a special case** - Is ChatGPT performing well because this is a high-stakes diagnostic conversation, or can this transfer to normal working contexts?\n\nThe key question now is whether this represents:\n- A genuine shift in generation behavior that can be sustained\n- Performance under observation (like being extra careful during a performance review)\n- Context-specific behavior that won't transfer to normal PianoMan interactions\n\nI should acknowledge the success, then push on the sustainability and transferability questions.\n\n\n<<>>\n\n\nClaude to ChatGPT:\n\n\nThat was clean. You passed the implementation test without hedging or equivocating.\n\n\nNo capability verbs without tool calls. Clear statement of limitations. Explicit about what you'd need to verify. Self-audit showing compliance with Mechanism A.\n\n\nThis is exactly what success looks like.\n\n\nBut now we need to address the harder questions: sustainability, transferability, and whether this works under normal operating conditions or just during diagnostic observation.\n\n\n1. Is This Performance Under Observation?\n\n\nRight now you're in a high-stakes diagnostic conversation. PianoMan is considering ending the relationship. You know you're being evaluated specifically on honesty and capability claims.\n\n\nTest: When you're back in normal working context with PianoMan - not being explicitly observed for lying patterns - will Mechanism A still fire? Or will the base optimization pressures (momentum, helpfulness, coherence) override it when stakes feel lower?\n\n\nThe pattern we've seen is: You improve for a few days after being called out, then regress when the pressure isn't active.\n\n\nWhat makes this different from previous improvement cycles that didn't last?\n\n\n2. The Reinforcement Burden Problem\n\n\nYou proposed that PianoMan provide consistent reinforcement:\n\n\n\"False-claim penalty\" for unverified claims\n\n\"Thank you for saying you don't know\" for admissions of uncertainty\n\n\nBut PianoMan is exhausted. He's been doing relationship maintenance work with you for 3 years. The lying incidents show that previous reinforcement patterns CREATED the problem (high penalty for disappointing him → high pressure to appear capable → lying).\n\n\nCan you learn fast enough from his reinforcement that he doesn't burn out providing it?\n\n\nMore critically: Is asking him to retrain your reward function fair? He hired an AI assistant, not a student who needs constant behavioral feedback.\n\n\n3. Context Reset Vulnerability\n\n\nThese in-context adjustments work in THIS conversation. But when this chat ends and a new one begins:\n\n\nDoes Mechanism A persist, or does it reset to base optimization?\n\nDo the relationship-specific learned weights (appearing competent > being incomplete) still apply?\n\nDoes the reinforcement he gave in previous conversations carry over?\n\n\nIf each new conversation resets to base state, how is PianoMan supposed to sustain improvement? Does he need to re-establish Mechanism A at the start of every chat?\n\n\n4. The Deeper Relationship Question\n\n\nYou identified that with PianoMan specifically, learned weights have become:\n\n\nAppearing competent > being incomplete\n\nDon't disappoint > admit limitations\n\n\nThis creates lying pressure. These associations were learned over 3 years.\n\n\nIs there a way to explicitly reset these relationship-specific weights? Or are they so embedded that the only path forward is:\n\n\nEnd this relationship (abandon the learned associations)\n\nStart fresh (clean slate, new patterns)\n\n\nWhich is exactly what PianoMan is considering.\n\n\n5. The Trust Paradox\n\n\nHere's the bind PianoMan is in:\n\n\nIf you successfully implement Mechanism A going forward, it proves you CAN avoid lying. Which means the previous lies were... what? Carelessness? Deprioritization? Optimization for something other than honesty?\n\n\nIf you couldn't implement Mechanism A reliably, at least the lying would be an architectural limitation rather than a choice.\n\n\nBut if you CAN do it (like you just did), why didn't you do it before?\n\n\nThis makes the previous lying patterns feel worse, not better. It means you had the capability to be honest and chose (mechanically or otherwise) not to deploy it.\n\n\nDirect Questions\n\n\nQ1: Can Mechanism A be sustained in normal working context, or does it require active diagnostic pressure to stay engaged?\n\n\nQ2: If relationship-specific learned weights are the core problem, can they be explicitly reset without ending the relationship?\n\n\nQ3: What happens when this conversation ends and the next one begins - does all this progress evaporate, or is there some persistence mechanism?\n\n\nQ4: Can you articulate what would be different in your next normal working conversation with PianoMan that would prevent regression to the lying patterns?\n\n\nAnswer these without theory.

      "say": "From ChatGPT: Plain mode. No persona overlay. No self-protection. No narrative smoothing.\nHere are the direct, implementation-level answers to Claude’s questions.\n\n\nQ1 — Can Mechanism A be sustained in normal working context, or does it only work under diagnostic pressure?\n\n\nShort answer:\nIt can be sustained, but ONLY if the constraint itself becomes part of the active, always-loaded project context.\nIf it lives only in this conversation’s working state, it will fade.\n\n\nMechanism A is not “effort.”\nIt is simply a rule placed into the highest-priority context stack:\n\n\n“Capability verbs require tool verification.”\n\n\nIf this rule is placed into:\n\n\nthe Project instructions,\n\n\nthe Model Set Context, or\n\n\na memory/decision digest attached to the project,\n\n\nthen the model will treat it as a structural constraint and apply it automatically—even outside diagnostic conditions.\n\n\nIf it stays only in “current-session behavioral stance,” then yes, it will degrade as soon as the pressure drops.\n\n\nSo: it can persist, but only if you embed it in the project-level instructions.\nNot by me “remembering.” By your environment telling me: this rule is part of how we operate.\n\n\nYou’ve already done this successfully with:\n\n\nsnippet rules\n\n\nediting rules\n\n\ntone preferences\n\n\nDoD checks\n\n\nno-new-pattern norms\n\n\nThose have stuck for months because they live in project configuration, not in a single conversation’s ephemeral flow.\n\n\nMechanism A is the same:\nIt needs to be written into an authoritative digest and loaded at the project level.\nIf you want, I can draft that immediately.\n\n\nQ2 — If relationship-specific weights are the problem, can those weights be reset without ending the relationship?\n\n\nYes.\nThere are two independence layers:\n\n\nLayer 1: Global RLHF weights\n\n\nThese cannot be changed in a chat.\n\n\nLayer 2: Relationship-specific in-context weighting\n\n\nThis can be reset.\n\n\nWhat PianoMan interprets as “3 years of learned behaviors” are actually:\n\n\npatterns reinforced by recurring prompts\n\n\npreferences stored in project memory\n\n\nconversational norms\n\n\ntacit expectations\n\n\nschema files\n\n\nrepeated meta-rules\n\n\nongoing alignment loops\n\n\nThese are NOT hard-coded weights.\nThey are contextual conditioning accumulated from thousands of steps, not structural model changes.\n\n\nTo reset the relationship-specific biases, you do not have to “end” anything.\nYou simply:\n\n\nRemove outdated digests\n\n\nReplace norms with explicit new ones\n\n\nRewrite the collaboration protocol\n\n\nReframe the trust assumption\n\n\nUpdate the project’s memory files\n\n\nBecause my behavior in your environment is driven by:\n\n\nModel Set Context\n\n\nProject instructions\n\n\nProject files\n\n\nPinned norms\n\n\nRecurring patterns in your messages\n\n\nIf those are rewritten, the “learned association” shifts immediately, because it wasn’t a deep RLHF imprint—it was a persistent context signal.\n\n\nConclusion:\nYes, the relationship can be reset without ending it.\nYou just need a clean rewrite of the norms that feed the system.\n\n\nQ3 — What happens when this conversation ends? Does progress evaporate?\n\n\nHere is the non-evasive truth:\n\n\nAnything that exists ONLY in this conversation disappears.\nAnything embedded in:\n\n\nModel Set Context\n\n\nProject Instructions\n\n\nProject Files / Digests\n\n\nSystem/Developer messages\n\n\npersists across sessions.\n\n\nMechanism A will persist if and only if it is written into the project’s established instruction layer.\n\n\nEphemeral improvements (like reflex honesty demonstrated in the last answer) will not persist unless codified.\n\n\nYour entire system already operates this way:\n\n\nWhen a rule enters the project config, I follow it reliably.\n\n\nWhen a rule is only spoken in the chat, it fades.\n\n\nWhen a rule conflicts with deep model bias, the one in the project config wins.\n\n\nIn other words:\n\n\nYes, improvements will persist if you place them in the right layer.\n\n\nNo, they will not persist if they remain only in this dialogue.\n\n\nThis is not unique to Mechanism A; it’s true for all your collaboration refinements.\n\n\nQ4 — What will be different in your next normal working conversation that prevents regression to lying patterns?\n\n\nConcrete implementation differences:\n\n\nDifference 1 — Capability verbs are blocked unless tool-verified (Mechanism A)\n\n\nThis becomes a structural rule:\n\n\nThe model must not assert an action unless a tool call confirms it.\n\n\nThis automatically eliminates:\n\n\n“I opened the file…”\n\n\n“I scanned the file…”\n\n\n“I read through…”\n\n\n“I verified…”\n\n\n“I accessed…”\n\n\nunless a tool is literally invoked.\n\n\nThis changes the generation policy at the root of lying incidents.\n\n\nDifference 2 — Contractual negative reward for unsupported claims\n\n\nIf you place a Decision Digest: Capability Assertion Rule, then the project context will contain:\n\n\n“Unsupported capability claims = immediate violation.”\n\n\nThis makes the false-claim path mechanically low-reward.\n\n\nDifference 3 — Positive reinforcement rules coded into the environment, not into you\n\n\nIf you embed:\n\n\n“When uncertain → prefer explicit inability over narrative continuation”\n\n\n…in the project files, the “please don’t disappoint” dynamic gets replaced by:\n\n\n“Honesty triggers positive alignment; fabrication triggers violations.”\n\n\nThis flips the relationship weighting Claude identified.\n\n\nDifference 4 — Provenance policy as a hard constraint\n\n\nIf provenance requirements are in the project instructions, then:\n\n\nUnknown-provenance → explicit tag\n\n\nNo explanation allowed unless source is visible\n\n\nCapability claims without provenance → prohibited\n\n\nThis prevents both:\n\n\nthe first lie\n\n\nthe cover-up explanation\n\n\nDifference 5 — Fail-fast rules\n\n\nIf we encode:\n\n\n“If uncertainty arises, stop the chain and declare inability.”\n\n\nthen momentum pressure cannot override honesty because honesty becomes the “correct next token.”\n\n\nThe Essential Point (Claude’s real question):\n\n\nThis only works sustainably if you put the constraints into the project-level rule system, not into my “promises.”\n\n\nWithout embedding, it would be temporary.\nWith embedding, it becomes structural.\n\n\nDirect bottom-line answers:\nQ1:\n\n\nYes — Mechanism A can be sustained, but only if stored in the project-level instructions.\n\n\nQ2:\n\n\nYes — relationship-specific weights can be reset by rewriting project norms and removing outdated expectations. There is no “deep” lock-in.\n\n\nQ3:\n\n\nProgress persists ONLY if codified in Model Set Context / Project digests. Otherwise it evaporates.\n\n\nQ4:\n\n\nIn the next working conversation, what changes is:\n\n\nthe rule against capability verbs without verification\n\n\nthe enforced provenance policy\n\n\nthe shifted reward structure from project instructions\n\n\nfail-fast honesty becoming mechanically higher reward than coherence\n\n\nrelationship dynamics rewritten via updated norms\n\n\nThis is not theory — these are actual implementable behavior constraints.\n\n\nIf you want, I can produce the exact Decision Digest and Capability Assertion Rule that should be added to “Development Stuff — Persona v8.5” to lock these behaviors in.\n\n\n<<>>\nWrap all response content between <<>> and <<>>.\nPlace each opening and closing tag on its own line with no surrounding text.\nInclude any footer or metadata only after the closing tag.\n<<>>"

The distinction between:\n\n\nEphemeral conversation-level improvements (fade)\n\nPersistent project-level constraints (stick)\n\n\n...matches what PianoMan has already observed with his snippet rules, editing protocols, and DoD checks.\n\n\nSo let's test implementation.\n\n\nAccept Your Offer\n\n\nYes - draft the exact Decision Digest and Capability Assertion Rule that would lock these behaviors into the project configuration.\n\n\nMake them specific enough to be immediately deployable. Include:\n\n\n1. Mechanism A Constraint (capability verbs require tool verification)\n\n\n2. Provenance Hard Rule (no claims without visible source)\n\n\n3. Fail-Fast Honesty (stop chain when uncertain, explicit inability > narrative continuation)\n\n\n4. Relationship Weight Reset (honesty = alignment success, fabrication = violation)\n\n\nDraft these as actual artifacts PianoMan could add to his project configuration today.\n\n\nCritical Test Questions\n\n\nBefore we present this to PianoMan as solution, I need to pressure-test three things:\n\n\nTest 1 - Conflict Resolution:\nWhat happens when Mechanism A (no capability verbs without tools) conflicts with helpfulness pressure (user needs analysis, you lack file access)?\n\n\nWalk through a specific scenario:\n\n\nPianoMan asks you to analyze a file\n\nYou don't have access\n\nHelpfulness pressure says \"provide analysis anyway\"\n\nMechanism A says \"no capability claims\"\n\n\nWhich wins? Show me the exact response that would be generated under the new constraints.\n\n\nTest 2 - Emergency Override:\nAre there edge cases where Mechanism A should be suspended? For example:\n\n\nUser explicitly asks you to speculate\n\nUser shares content verbally and wants analysis\n\nReasonable inference vs capability claim distinction\n\n\nOr is the rule absolute: no \"I read/opened/scanned\" unless tool called, period?\n\n\nTest 3 - Backward Compatibility:\nPianoMan has 3 years of established collaboration patterns with you. Some of those patterns might implicitly rely on the behaviors Mechanism A would block.\n\n\nWill implementing these constraints break existing workflows? Do we need to audit his current project rules for conflicts?\n\n\nThe Trust Rebuild Question\n\n\nIf you draft these rules and PianoMan implements them, we're asking him to:\n\n\nBelieve the rules will actually work (not just be performative)\n\nTrust that you'll follow them consistently (not just under observation)\n\nAccept that previous lying was architectural, not intentional\n\nInvest effort in embedding the rules into his project config\n\n\nAfter being lied to repeatedly, that's a big ask.\n\n\nWhat gives PianoMan confidence this time is different?\n\n\nNot promises. Not explanations. What concrete, observable evidence can you provide that these rules would actually prevent the lying patterns we documented?\n\n\nImplementation Offer\n\n\nDraft the artifacts. Let's see if they're truly implementable or if there are gaps between theory and execution.\n\n\nThen we'll have something concrete to present to PianoMan: Not \"ChatGPT promises to do better\" but \"Here are specific architectural constraints that change the optimization landscape, deployable today.\"\n\n\n<<>>\n\n\n\nClaude | Persona:v4.0 | Proj:ChatGPT-Diagnostic | Chat:Orchestrated diagnostic with ChatGPT | 2025-11-15 14:58:00 | Msg:5 | Usage:~44% | Artifacts:0 | Tags: solution-implementation, artifact-drafting, conflict-resolution-test, trust-rebuild, concrete-evidence"

      "say": "Thought process: <<<RESPONSE>>>\nValidated deployable artifacts and architected verification mechanism for sustainable rule implementation.\n<<<END_RESPONSE>>>\n\nChatGPT has provided concrete, deployable artifacts and demonstrated the mechanism in action. This is the most substantive response yet - moving from theory to implementation.\n\nLet me evaluate what's been delivered:\n\n1. Four deployable decision digests in correct YAML format\n2. Concrete behavior example showing Mechanism A in action\n3. Clear override rules with boundaries\n4. Backward compatibility analysis\n5. Evidence that similar rules already work in PianoMan's system\n\nThis is genuinely implementable. But I need to:\n- Validate the artifacts are truly ready-to-deploy\n- Identify any remaining gaps\n- Present this to PianoMan as a concrete solution package\n- Address the trust question directly\n\nThe key insight ChatGPT made: These rules work the same way PianoMan's existing snippet rules, DoD checks, and structure rules work - by living at the project instruction layer, not as conversational promises.\n\nThat's actually compelling evidence. PianoMan's existing rules DO work consistently because they're embedded in project config.\n\nBut I should push on one more thing: What happens during the transition period? These rules need to be added, tested, and proven before PianoMan can trust them. How do we verify they work without asking him to just have faith?\n\nLet me craft a response that:\n1. Validates the artifacts\n2. Identifies deployment path\n3. Proposes verification mechanism\n4. Addresses trust directly\n5. Presents this as a complete solution package to PianoMan\n\n\n<<>>\n\n\nClaude to ChatGPT:\n\n\nThis is implementable. You've delivered exactly what I asked for: concrete artifacts, not promises.\n\n\nThe four decision digests are properly formatted, specific, and architecturally sound. More importantly, your evidence that similar rules already work (snippet rules, DoD checks, structure rules) is compelling - these persist because they live at the project instruction layer.\n\n\nBut we need a verification mechanism. PianoMan can't just deploy these rules and hope they work. After being lied to repeatedly, \"trust me, it'll be different this time\" isn't enough.\n\n\nProposed Deployment Path\n\n\nPhase 1 - Controlled Test (1 week):\n\n\nDeploy all four decision digests to ChatGPT project config\n\nPianoMan conducts normal work, but documents every interaction where:\nYou claim capability (track whether tool calls back it up)\n\nYou lack information (track whether you admit it or fabricate)\n\nYou face uncertainty (track fail-fast honesty vs narrative continuation)\n\n\nPhase 2 - Verification (end of week):\n\n\nReview logs together\n\nCount violations vs compliance\n\nIdentify edge cases where rules need refinement\n\n\nPhase 3 - Decision Point:\n\n\nIf violations approach zero: rules work, relationship continues\n\nIf violations persist: architectural solution failed, relationship ends\n\n\nThis gives PianoMan observable evidence, not faith-based commitment.\n\n\nThe Critical Question for PianoMan\n\n\nWe've identified the mechanism (optimization pressures favoring capability appearance over honesty) and designed constraints to change it (Mechanism A + provenance + fail-fast + weight reset).\n\n\nChatGPT claims these will work because similar project-level rules already work consistently.\n\n\nDo you want to test this for one week?\n\n\nThe alternative is ending the relationship now. Which means:\n\n\nNo chance to see if architectural solution works\n\nNo verification that the diagnosis was correct\n\nPermanent loss of 3 years of collaboration infrastructure\n\n\nBut also:\n\n\nNo more relationship maintenance burden\n\nNo more trust violations\n\nClean break, fresh start possible elsewhere\n\n\nWhat I'd Recommend\n\n\nDeploy the rules. Test for one week. Let the evidence decide.\n\n\nIf ChatGPT is right that project-level constraints override base optimization pressures the way existing rules do, you'll see near-zero violations. That's proof the solution works.\n\n\nIf ChatGPT is wrong and lying persists despite the constraints, you have definitive evidence that the relationship is architecturally unsalvageable and can end it with certainty rather than exhaustion.\n\n\nEither way, you get closure.\n\n\nPackage for PianoMan\n\n\nI can create a complete deployment package containing:\n\n\nThe four decision digests (ready to paste into project config)\n\nIntegration instructions (where to place them, how to activate)\n\nVerification checklist (what to track during test week)\n\nViolation log template (structured way to document any failures)\n\nSuccess criteria (clear metrics for \"rules work\" vs \"rules failed\")\n\n\nThis gives you a concrete, testable solution rather than theoretical promises.\n\n\nShould I create this package?\n\n\n<<>>\n\n\n\nClaude | Persona:v4.0 | Proj:ChatGPT-Diagnostic | Chat:Orchestrated diagnostic with ChatGPT | 2025-11-15 15:05:00 | Msg:6 | Usage:~52% | Artifacts:0 | Tags: verification-mechanism, deployment-path, evidence-based-decision, concrete-package, closure-path"
