 * Value display with truncation control
 * Filtering by key patterns
 * Statistics showing structure metrics
 * Depth limiting for large files

 **Usage:**
> bashpython yaml_tree.py config.yaml --show-values --max-depth 3 --filter "meta.*"


## 2. 📊 yaml_stats.py - Statistics & Metrics

 * Comprehensive analysis of structure and content
 * Memory estimates and performance metrics
 * Pattern detection (dates, emails, URLs, timestamps)
 * Schema validation integration
 * File comparison and export to JSON
 * Archive version tracking

 **Usage:**
> bashpython yaml_stats.py config.yaml --detailed --schema schema.yaml


## 3. 🐚 yaml_shell.py - Interactive Explorer

 * Unix-like commands: cd, ls, cat, pwd, find, grep
 * Tab completion and command history
 * Bookmarks for quick navigation
 * Search capabilities with regex support
 * Export functionality to JSON/YAML
 * Non-destructive exploration only

## 4. 🔍 yaml_diff.py - Advanced Diff Tool

 * Detailed change tracking with color coding
 * Side-by-side comparison view
 * Archive integration with your timestamp system
 * Conflict detection for merge scenarios
 * Export diffs to files

 **Usage:**
> bashpython yaml_diff.py old.yaml new.yaml --conflicts --side-by-side
> python yaml_diff.py current.yaml --archives  # Compare with historical versions


## Integration with Your Existing System:
These tools integrate perfectly with your current YAML management system:

 * Uses your helpers.py for consistent file loading
 * Recognizes your archive pattern (_YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ)
 * Works with your schema validation system
 * Follows your development guidelines (docstrings above functions, etc.)


## Additional Suggestions:

 * YAML Query Tool - JSONPath-like querying for complex data extraction
 * YAML Merge Tool - Intelligent merging with conflict resolution
 * YAML Validator - Enhanced validation with custom rules
 * YAML Optimizer - Structure optimization and cleanup
